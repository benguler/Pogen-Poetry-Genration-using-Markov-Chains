The day before Curl Trenary,modern
Swore out a warrant through Justice Arnett,modern
For stealing hogs.,modern
But that's not the reason he turned a soldier.,modern
He caught me running with Lucius Atherton.,modern
We quarreled and I told him never again,modern
To cross my path.,modern
Then he stole the hogs and went to the war,modern
Back of every soldier is a woman.He protested all his life long,modern
The newspapers lied about him villainously;,modern
"That he was not at fault for Minerva's fall,",modern
But only tried to help her.,modern
Poor soul so sunk in sin he could not see,modern
"That even trying to help her, as he called it,",modern
He had broken the law human and divine.,modern
"Passers by, an ancient admonition to you:",modern
"If your ways would be ways of pleasantness,",modern
"And all your pathways peace,",modern
Love God and keep his commandments.,modern
"And lights were paling out of the West,",modern
"You would come hither, and bend your head,",modern
And I would lay my head on your breast;,modern
"And you would murmur tender words,",modern
"Forgiving me, because you were dead:",modern
"Nor would you rise and hasten away,",modern
"Though you have the will of wild birds,",modern
But know your hair was bound and wound,modern
About the stars and moon and sun:,modern
"O would, beloved, that you lay",modern
"Under the dock-leaves in the ground,",modern
"While lights were paling one by one.Never give all the heart, for love",modern
Will hardly seem worth thinking of,modern
To passionate women if it seem,modern
"Certain, and they never dream",modern
That it fades out from kiss to kiss;,modern
For everything thats lovely is,modern
"But a brief, dreamy, kind delight.",modern
"O never give the heart outright,",modern
"For they, for all smooth lips can say,",modern
Have given their hearts up to the play.,modern
And who could play it well enough,modern
If deaf and dumb and blind with love?,modern
"He that made this knows all the cost,",modern
For he gave all his heart and lost.Why should I blame her that she filled my days,modern
"With misery, or that she would of late",modern
"Have taught to ignorant men most violent ways,",modern
"Or hurled the little streets upon the great,",modern
Had they but courage equal to desire?,modern
What could have made her peaceful with a mind,modern
"That nobleness made simple as a fire,",modern
"With beauty like a tightened bow, a kind",modern
"That is not natural in an age like this,",modern
Being high and solitary and most stern?,modern
"Why, what could she have done, being what she is?",modern
Was there another Troy for her to burn?Some may have blamed you that you took away,modern
The verses that could move them on the day,modern
"When, the ears being deafened, the sight of the eyes blind",modern
"With lightning, you went from me, and I could find",modern
"Nothing to make a song about but kings,",modern
"Helmets, and swords, and half-forgotten things",modern
That were like memories of youbut now,modern
"We'll out, for the world lives as long ago;",modern
"And while we're in our laughing, weeping fit,",modern
"Hurl helmets, crowns, and swords into the pit.",modern
"But, dear, cling close to me; since you were gone,",modern
"My barren thoughts have chilled me to the bone. Shy one, shy one,",modern
"Shy one of my heart,",modern
She moves in the firelight,modern
Pensively apart.,modern
"She carries in the dishes,",modern
And lays them in a row.,modern
To an isle in the water,modern
With her would I go.,modern
"She carries in the candles,",modern
"And lights the curtained room,",modern
Shy in the doorway,modern
And shy in the gloom;,modern
"And shy as a rabbit,",modern
Helpful and shy.,modern
To an isle in the water,modern
"With her would I fly.I feel the spring far off, far off,",modern
"The faint, far scent of bud and leaf",modern
"Oh, how can spring take heart to come",modern
"To a world in grief,",modern
Deep grief?,modern
"The sun turns north, the days grow long,",modern
Later the evening star grows bright,modern
How can the daylight linger on,modern
"For men to fight,",modern
Still fight?,modern
"The grass is waking in the ground,",modern
Soon it will rise and blow in waves,modern
How can it have the heart to sway,modern
"Over the graves,",modern
New graves?,modern
Under the boughs where lovers walked,modern
The apple-blooms will shed their breath,modern
But what of all the lovers now,modern
"Parted by Death,",modern
"Grey Death?Lying in dug-outs, joking idly, wearily;",modern
Watching the candle guttering in the draught;,modern
"Hearing the great shells go high over us, eerily",modern
"Singing; how often have I turned over, and laughed",modern
"With pity and pride, photographs of all colours,",modern
"All sizes, subjects: khaki brothers in France;",modern
Or mother's faces worn with countless dolours;,modern
"Or girls whose eyes were challenging and must dance,",modern
"Though in a picture only, a common cheap",modern
"Ill-taken card; and childrenfrozen, some",modern
waiting on Dicky-bird to peep,modern
Out of the handkerchief that is his home,modern
"But he's so shy! And some with bright looks, calling",modern
"Delight across the miles of land and sea,",modern
That not the dread of barrage suddenly falling,modern
Could quite blot outnot mud nor lethargy.,modern
Smiles and triumphant careless laughter. O,modern
"The pain of them, wide Earth's most sacred things! ",modern
"Lying in dug-outs, hearing the great shells slow",modern
"Sailing mile-high, the heart mounts higher and sings.",modern
But onceO why did he keep that bitter token,modern
"Of a dead Love?that boy, who, suddenly moved,",modern
"Showed me, his eyes wet, his low talk broken,",modern
"A girl who better had not been beloved.I went out to the hazel wood,",modern
"Because a fire was in my head,",modern
"And cut and peeled a hazel wand,",modern
And hooked a berry to a thread;,modern
"And when white moths were on the wing,",modern
"And moth-like stars were flickering out,",modern
I dropped the berry in a stream,modern
And caught a little silver trout.,modern
When I had laid it on the floor,modern
"I went to blow the fire a-flame,",modern
"But something rustled on the floor,",modern
And someone called me by my name:,modern
It had become a glimmering girl,modern
With apple blossom in her hair,modern
Who called me by my name and ran,modern
And faded through the brightening air.,modern
Though I am old with wandering,modern
"Through hollow lands and hilly lands,",modern
"I will find out where she has gone,",modern
And kiss her lips and take her hands;,modern
"And walk among long dappled grass,",modern
"And pluck till time and times are done,",modern
"The silver apples of the moon,",modern
The golden apples of the sun.Now that I know,modern
That passion warms little,modern
"Of flesh in the mold,",modern
"And treasure is brittle,",modern
Ill lie here and learn,modern
"How, over their ground,",modern
Trees make a long shadow,modern
And a light sound.,modern
"The stars are hiding now,",modern
"And frowning on the world, love,",modern
Night bares her sable brow.,modern
"The snow is on the ground, love,",modern
And cold and keen the air is.,modern
"Im singing here to you, love;",modern
Youre dreaming there in Paris.,modern
"But this is Natures law, love,",modern
"Though just it may not seem,",modern
"That men should wake to sing, love;",modern
While maidens sleep and dream.,modern
"Them care may not molest, love,",modern
"Nor stir them from their slumbers,",modern
"Though midnight find the swain, love.",modern
Still halting oer his numbers.,modern
"I watch the rosy dawn, love,",modern
"Come stealing up the east,",modern
"While all things round rejoice, love,",modern
That Night her reign has ceased.,modern
"The lark will soon be heard, love,",modern
And on his way be winging;,modern
"When Natures poets, wake, love,",modern
"Why should a man be singing?Thou art my lute, by thee I sing,",modern
My being is attuned to thee.,modern
"Thou settest all my words a-wing,",modern
And meltest me to melody.,modern
"Thou art my life, by thee I live,",modern
From thee proceed the joys I know;,modern
"Sweetheart, thy hand has power to give",modern
The meed of lovethe cup of woe.,modern
"Thou art my love, by thee I lead",modern
"My soul the paths of light along,",modern
"From vale to vale, from mead to mead,",modern
And home it in the hills of song.,modern
"My song, my soul, my life, my all,",modern
"Why need I pray or make my plea,",modern
Since my petition cannot fall;,modern
For Im already one with thee!Wine comes in at the mouth,modern
And love comes in at the eye;,modern
Thats all we shall know for truth,modern
Before we grow old and die.,modern
"I lift the glass to my mouth,",modern
"I look at you, and I sigh.Bilbea, I was in Babylon on Saturday night.",modern
I saw nothing of you anywhere.,modern
"I was at the old place and the other girls were there,",modern
But no Bilbea.,modern
Have you gone to another house? or city?,modern
Why dont you write?,modern
I was sorry. I walked home half-sick.,modern
Tell me how it goes.,modern
Send me some kind of a letter.,modern
"And take care of yourself.How much do you love me, a million bushels?",modern
"Oh, a lot more than that, Oh, a lot more.",modern
And tomorrow maybe only half a bushel?,modern
Tomorrow maybe not even a half a bushel.,modern
And is this your heart arithmetic?,modern
This is the way the wind measures the weather.,modern
When the world turns completely upside down,modern
You say well emigrate to the Eastern Shore,modern
Aboard a river-boat from Baltimore;,modern
"Well live among wild peach trees, miles from town,",modern
"Youll wear a coonskin cap, and I a gown",modern
"Homespun, dyed butternuts dark gold color.",modern
"Lost, like your lotus-eating ancestor,",modern
Well swim in milk and honey till we drown.,modern
"The winter will be short, the summer long,",modern
"The autumn amber-hued, sunny and hot,",modern
Tasting of cider and of scuppernong;,modern
"All seasons sweet, but autumn best of all.",modern
The squirrels in their silver fur will fall,modern
"Like falling leaves, like fruit, before your shot.",modern
The autumn frosts will lie upon the grass,modern
Like bloom on grapes of purple-brown and gold.,modern
The misted early mornings will be cold;,modern
The little puddles will be roofed with glass.,modern
"The sun, which burns from copper into brass,",modern
"Melts these at noon, and makes the boys unfold",modern
Their knitted mufflers; full as they can hold,modern
Fat pockets dribble chestnuts as they pass.,modern
"Peaches grow wild, and pigs can live in clover;",modern
A barrel of salted herrings lasts a year;,modern
The spring begins before the winters over.,modern
By February you may find the skins,modern
Of garter snakes and water moccasins,modern
"Dwindled and harsh, dead-white and cloudy-clear.",modern
When April pours the colors of a shell,modern
"Upon the hills, when every little creek",modern
Is shot with silver from the Chesapeake,modern
"In shoals new-minted by the ocean swell,",modern
"When strawberries go begging, and the sleek",modern
"Blue plums lie open to the blackbirds beak,",modern
We shall live well  we shall live very well.,modern
The months between the cherries and the peaches,modern
Are brimming cornucopias which spill,modern
"Fruits red and purple, sombre-bloomed and black;",modern
"Then, down rich fields and frosty river beaches",modern
"Well trample bright persimmons, while you kill",modern
"Bronze partridge, speckled quail, and canvasback.",modern
Down to the Puritan marrow of my bones,modern
Theres something in this richness that I hate.,modern
"I love the look, austere, immaculate,",modern
Of landscapes drawn in pearly monotones.,modern
Theres something in my very blood that owns,modern
"Bare hills, cold silver on a sky of slate,",modern
"A thread of water, churned to milky spate",modern
Streaming through slanted pastures fenced with stones.,modern
"I love those skies, thin blue or snowy gray,",modern
"Those fields sparse-planted, rendering meagre sheaves;",modern
"That spring, briefer than apple-blossoms breath,",modern
"Summer, so much too beautiful to stay,",modern
"Swift autumn, like a bonfire of leaves,",modern
"And sleepy winter, like the sleep of death.",modern
"The eyes of the very learned British Museum assistant.We sat together at one summers end,",modern
"That beautiful mild woman, your close friend,   ",modern
"And you and I, and talked of poetry.",modern
"I said, A line will take us hours maybe;",modern
"Yet if it does not seem a moments thought,   ",modern
Our stitching and unstitching has been naught.   ,modern
Better go down upon your marrow-bones   ,modern
"And scrub a kitchen pavement, or break stones   ",modern
"Like an old pauper, in all kinds of weather;   ",modern
For to articulate sweet sounds together,modern
"Is to work harder than all these, and yet   ",modern
Be thought an idler by the noisy set,modern
"Of bankers, schoolmasters, and clergymen   ",modern
The martyrs call the world.,modern
That beautiful mild woman for whose sake   ,modern
Theres many a one shall find out all heartache   ,modern
On finding that her voice is sweet and low   ,modern
"Replied, To be born woman is to know",modern
Although they do not talk of it at school,modern
That we must labour to be beautiful.,modern
"I said, Its certain there is no fine thing   ",modern
Since Adams fall but needs much labouring.,modern
There have been lovers who thought love should be   ,modern
So much compounded of high courtesy   ,modern
That they would sigh and quote with learned looks   ,modern
Precedents out of beautiful old books;   ,modern
Yet now it seems an idle trade enough.,modern
We sat grown quiet at the name of love;   ,modern
"We saw the last embers of daylight die,   ",modern
And in the trembling blue-green of the sky   ,modern
"A moon, worn as if it had been a shell   ",modern
Washed by times waters as they rose and fell   ,modern
About the stars and broke in days and years.,modern
I had a thought for no ones but your ears:   ,modern
"That you were beautiful, and that I strove   ",modern
To love you in the old high way of love;,modern
"That it had all seemed happy, and yet wed grown   ",modern
"As weary-hearted as that hollow moon.I wanted you, nameless Woman of the South,",modern
"No wraith, but utterlyas still more alone",modern
The Southern Cross takes night,modern
"And lifts her girdles from her, one by one",modern
"High, cool,",modern
wide from the slowly smoldering fire,modern
"Of lower heavens,",modern
vaporous scars!,modern
Eve! Magdalene!,modern
"or Mary, you?",modern
Whatever callfalls vainly on the wave.,modern
"O simian Venus, homeless Eve,",modern
"Unwedded, stumbling gardenless to grieve",modern
Windswept guitars on lonely decks forever;,modern
Finally to answer all within one grave!,modern
"And this long wake of phosphor,",modern
Furrow of all our traveltrailed derision!,modern
Eyes crumble at its kiss. Its long-drawn spell,modern
Incites a yell. Slid on that backward vision,modern
"The mind is churned to spittle, whispering hell.",modern
I wanted you . . . The embers of the Cross,modern
Climbed by aslant and huddling aromatically.,modern
It is blood to remember; it is fire,modern
To stammer back . . . It is,modern
Godyour namelessness. And the wash,modern
All night the water combed you with black,modern
"Insolence. You crept out simmering, accomplished.",modern
"Water rattled that stinging coil, your",modern
"Rehearsed hairdocile, alas, from many arms.",modern
"Yes, Evewraith of my unloved seed!",modern
"The Cross, a phantom, buckleddropped below the dawn.",modern
Light drowned the lithic trillions of your spawn.,modern
my love and I did meet;,modern
She passed the salley gardens,modern
with little snow-white feet.,modern
"She bid me take love easy,",modern
as the leaves grow on the tree;,modern
"But I, being young and foolish,",modern
with her would not agree.,modern
In a field by the river,modern
"my love and I did stand,",modern
And on my leaning shoulder,modern
she laid her snow-white hand.,modern
"She bid me take life easy,",modern
as the grass grows on the weirs;,modern
"But I was young and foolish,",modern
and now am full of tears.,modern
"You dweller in the dark cabin,",modern
"To whom the watermelon is always purple,   ",modern
"Whose garden is wind and moon,",modern
"Of the two dreams, night and day,",modern
"What lover, what dreamer, would choose   ",modern
The one obscured by sleep?,modern
Here is the plantain by your door   ,modern
And the best cock of red feather   ,modern
That crew before the clocks.,modern
"A feme may come, leaf-green,   ",modern
Whose coming may give revel   ,modern
"Beyond revelries of sleep,",modern
"Yes, and the blackbird spread its tail,   ",modern
"So that the sun may speckle,   ",modern
While it creaks hail.,modern
"You dweller in the dark cabin,   ",modern
"Rise, since rising will not waken,   ",modern
"And hail, cry hail, cry hail.",modern
Come when the nights are bright with stars,modern
Or come when the moon is mellow;,modern
Come when the sun his golden bars,modern
Drops on the hay-field yellow.,modern
"Come in the twilight soft and gray,",modern
"Come in the night or come in the day,",modern
"Come, O love, wheneer you may,",modern
"And you are welcome, welcome.",modern
"You are sweet, O Love, dear Love,",modern
You are soft as the nesting dove.,modern
Come to my heart and bring it to rest,modern
As the bird flies home to its welcome nest.,modern
Come when my heart is full of grief,modern
Or when my heart is merry;,modern
Come with the falling of the leaf,modern
Or with the reddning cherry.,modern
"Come when the years first blossom blows,",modern
"Come when the summer gleams and glows,",modern
"Come with the winters drifting snows,",modern
"And you are welcome, welcome.",modern
While my hair was still cut straight across my forehead,modern
"I played about the front gate, pulling flowers.",modern
"You came by on bamboo stilts, playing horse,",modern
"You walked about my seat, playing with blue plums.",modern
And we went on living in the village of Chokan:,modern
"Two small people, without dislike or suspicion.",modern
At fourteen I married My Lord you.,modern
"I never laughed, being bashful.",modern
"Lowering my head, I looked at the wall.",modern
"Called to, a thousand times, I never looked back.",modern
"At fifteen I stopped scowling,",modern
I desired my dust to be mingled with yours,modern
"Forever and forever, and forever.",modern
Why should I climb the look out?,modern
At sixteen you departed,modern
"You went into far Ku-to-en, by the river of swirling eddies,",modern
And you have been gone five months.,modern
The monkeys make sorrowful noise overhead.,modern
You dragged your feet when you went out.,modern
"By the gate now, the moss is grown, the different mosses,",modern
Too deep to clear them away!,modern
"The leaves fall early this autumn, in wind.",modern
The paired butterflies are already yellow with August,modern
Over the grass in the West garden;,modern
They hurt me.,modern
I grow older.,modern
"If you are coming down through the narrows of the river Kiang,",modern
"Please let me know beforehand,",modern
And I will come out to meet you,modern
"As far as Cho-fu-Sa.Since there is no escape, since at the end",modern
"My body will be utterly destroyed,",modern
"This hand I love as I have loved a friend,",modern
"This body I tended, wept with and enjoyed;",modern
Since there is no escape even for me,modern
Who love life with a love too sharp to bear:,modern
"The scent of orchards in the rain, the sea",modern
And hours alone too still and sure for prayer,modern
"Since darkness waits for me, then all the more",modern
Let me go down as waves sweep to the shore,modern
"In pride, and let me sing with my last breath;",modern
In these few hours of light I lift my head;,modern
Life is my loverI shall leave the dead,modern
If there is any way to baffle death.,modern
"Too high, too high to pluck",modern
My heart shall swing.,modern
"A fruit no bee shall suck,",modern
No wasp shall sting.,modern
If on some night of cold,modern
It falls to ground,modern
In apple-leaves of gold,modern
Ill wrap it round.,modern
And I shall seal it up,modern
"With spice and salt,",modern
"In a carven silver cup,",modern
In a deep vault.,modern
Before my eyes are blind,modern
"And my lips mute,",modern
I must eat core and rind,modern
Of that same fruit.,modern
Before my heart is dust,modern
"At the end of all,",modern
"Eat it I must, I must",modern
Were it bitter gall.,modern
But I shall keep it sweet,modern
By some strange art;,modern
Wild honey I shall eat,modern
When I eat my heart.,modern
O honey cool and chaste,modern
As clovers breath!,modern
Sweet Heaven I shall taste,modern
Before my death.When the first dark had fallen around them,modern
"And the leaves were weary of praise,",modern
In the clear silence Beauty found them,modern
And shewed them all her ways.,modern
In the high noon of the heavenly garden,modern
"Where the angels sunned with the birds,",modern
"Beauty, before their hearts could harden,",modern
Had taught them heavenly words.,modern
When they fled in the burning weather,modern
"And nothing dawned but a dream,",modern
Beauty fasted their hands together,modern
And cooled them at her stream.,modern
"And when day wearied and night grew stronger,",modern
"And they slept as the beautiful must,",modern
"Then she bided a little longer,",modern
"And blossomed from their dust.My love looks like a girl to-night,",modern
But she is old.,modern
The plaits that lie along her pillow,modern
"Are not gold,",modern
"But threaded with filigree silver,",modern
And uncanny cold.,modern
"She looks like a young maiden, since her brow",modern
"Is smooth and fair,",modern
"Her cheeks are very smooth, her eyes are closed.",modern
She sleeps a rare,modern
"Still winsome sleep, so still, and so composed.",modern
"Nay, but she sleeps like a bride, and dreams her dreams",modern
Of perfect things.,modern
"She lies at last, the darling, in the shape of her dream,",modern
And her dead mouth sings,modern
"By its shape, like the thrushes in clear evenings.The jester walked in the garden:",modern
The garden had fallen still;,modern
He bade his soul rise upward,modern
And stand on her window-sill.,modern
"It rose in a straight blue garment,",modern
When owls began to call:,modern
It had grown wise-tongued by thinking,modern
Of a quiet and light footfall;,modern
But the young queen would not listen;,modern
She rose in her pale night-gown;,modern
She drew in the heavy casement,modern
And pushed the latches down.,modern
"He bade his heart go to her,",modern
When the owls called out no more;,modern
In a red and quivering garment,modern
It sang to her through the door.,modern
It had grown sweet-tongued by dreaming,modern
Of a flutter of flower-like hair;,modern
But she took up her fan from the table,modern
And waved it off on the air.,modern
"'I have cap and bells, he pondered,",modern
'I will send them to her and die;,modern
And when the morning whitened,modern
He left them where she went by.,modern
"She laid them upon her bosom,",modern
"Under a cloud of her hair,",modern
And her red lips sang them a love-song,modern
Till stars grew out of the air.,modern
"She opened her door and her window,",modern
"And the heart and the soul came through,",modern
"To her right hand came the red one,",modern
To her left hand came the blue.,modern
"They set up a noise like crickets,",modern
"A chattering wise and sweet,",modern
And her hair was a folded flower,modern
"And the quiet of love in her feet.What large, dark hands are those at the window",modern
"Lifted, grasping the golden light",modern
Which weaves its way through the creeper leaves,modern
To my heart's delight?,modern
"Ah, only the leaves! But in the west,",modern
In the west I see a redness come,modern
Over the evening's burning breast ,modern
Tis the wound of love goes home!,modern
The woodbine creeps abroad,modern
Calling low to her lover:,modern
The sun-lit flirt who all the day,modern
Has poised above her lips in play,modern
"And stolen kisses, shallow and gay",modern
"Of pollen, now has gone away",modern
"She woos the moth with her sweet, low word,",modern
And when above her his broad wings hover,modern
Then her bright breast she will uncover,modern
And yield her honey-drop to her lover.,modern
"Into the yellow, evening glow",modern
"Saunters a man from the farm below,",modern
"Leans, and looks in at the low-built shed",modern
Where hangs the swallow's marriage bed.,modern
The bird lies warm against the wall.,modern
She glances quick her startled eyes,modern
"Towards him, then she turns away",modern
"Her small head, making warm display",modern
Of red upon the throat. His terrors sway,modern
"Her out of the nest's warm, busy ball,",modern
Whose plaintive cry is heard as she flies,modern
In one blue stoop from out the sties,modern
Into the evening's empty hall.,modern
"Oh, water-hen, beside the rushes",modern
"Hide your quaint, unfading blushes,",modern
"Still your quick tail, and lie as dead,",modern
Till the distance folds over his ominous tread.,modern
"The rabbit presses back her ears,",modern
"Turns back her liquid, anguished eyes",modern
And crouches low: then with wild spring,modern
Spurts from the terror of his oncoming,modern
"To be choked back, the wire ring",modern
Her frantic effort throttling:,modern
Piteous brown ball of quivering fears!,modern
"Ah soon in his large, hard hands she dies,",modern
And swings all loose to the swing of his walk.,modern
Yet calm and kindly are his eyes,modern
And ready to open in brown surprise,modern
Should I not answer to his talk,modern
Or should he my tears surmise.,modern
"I hear his hand on the latch, and rise from my chair",modern
Watching the door open: he flashes bare,modern
"His strong teeth in a smile, and flashes his eyes",modern
In a smile like triumph upon me; then careless-wise,modern
He flings the rabbit soft on the table board,modern
"And comes towards me: ah, the uplifted sword",modern
"Of his hand against my bosom, and oh, the broad",modern
Blade of his hand that raises my face to applaud,modern
His coming: he raises up my face to him,modern
"And caresses my mouth with his fingers, which still smell grim",modern
"Of the rabbit's fur! God, I am caught in a snare!",modern
"I know not what fine wire is round my throat,",modern
I only know I let him finger there,modern
"My pulse of life, letting him nose like a stoat",modern
Who sniffs with joy before he drinks the blood:,modern
"And down his mouth comes to my mouth, and down",modern
His dark bright eyes descend like a fiery hood,modern
"Upon my mind: his mouth meets mine, and a flood",modern
"Of sweet fire sweeps across me, so I drown",modern
"Within him, die, and find death good.Supper comes at five o'clock,",modern
"At six, the evening star,",modern
My lover comes at eight o'clock,modern
But eight o'clock is far.,modern
How could I bear my pain all day,modern
Unless I watched to see,modern
The clock-hands laboring to bring,modern
"Eight o'clock to me.Go, dumb-born book,",modern
Tell her that sang me once that song of Lawes:,modern
Hadst thou but song,modern
"As thou hast subjects known,",modern
Then were there cause in thee that should condone,modern
Even my faults that heavy upon me lie,modern
And build her glories their longevity.,modern
Tell her that sheds,modern
"Such treasure in the air,",modern
Recking naught else but that her graces give,modern
"Life to the moment,",modern
I would bid them live,modern
"As roses might, in magic amber laid,",modern
Red overwrought with orange and all made,modern
One substance and one colour,modern
Braving time.,modern
Tell her that goes,modern
With song upon her lips,modern
"But sings not out the song, nor knows",modern
"The maker of it, some other mouth,",modern
"May be as fair as hers,",modern
"Might, in new ages, gain her worshippers,",modern
"When our two dusts with Wallers shall be laid,",modern
"Siftings on siftings in oblivion,",modern
Till change hath broken down,modern
"All things save Beauty alone.They came to tell your faults to me,",modern
They named them over one by one;,modern
"I laughed aloud when they were done,",modern
"I knew them all so well before, ",modern
"Oh, they were blind, too blind to see",modern
Your faults had made me love you more.I never knew the earth had so much gold,modern
"The fields run over with it, and this hill",modern
"Hoary and old,",modern
Is young with buoyant blooms that flame and thrill.,modern
"Such golden fires, such yellowlo, how good",modern
"This spendthrift world, and what a lavish God!",modern
"This fringe of wood,",modern
Blazing with buttercup and goldenrod.,modern
"You too, beloved, are changed. Again I see",modern
"Your face grow mystical, as on that night",modern
"You turned to me,",modern
And all the trembling worldand youwere white.,modern
"Aye, you are touched; your singing lips grow dumb;",modern
"The fields absorb you, color you entire . . .",modern
And you become,modern
A goddess standing in a world of fire!When she rises in the morning,modern
I linger to watch her;,modern
She spreads the bath-cloth underneath the window,modern
And the sunbeams catch her,modern
"Glistening white on the shoulders,",modern
While down her sides the mellow,modern
Golden shadow glows as,modern
"She stoops to the sponge, and her swung breasts",modern
Sway like full-blown yellow,modern
Gloire de Dijon roses.,modern
"She drips herself with water, and her shoulders",modern
"Glisten as silver, they crumple up",modern
"Like wet and falling roses, and I listen",modern
For the sluicing of their rain-dishevelled petals.,modern
In the window full of sunlight,modern
Concentrates her golden shadow,modern
"Fold on fold, until it glows as",modern
Mellow as the glory roses.,modern
"Yours is the shame and sorrow,",modern
But the disgrace is mine;,modern
"Your love was dark and thorough,",modern
Mine was the love of the sun for a flower,modern
He creates with his shine.,modern
"I was diligent to explore you,",modern
"Blossom you stalk by stalk,",modern
Till my fire of creation bore you,modern
Shrivelling down in the final dour,modern
Anguish  then I suffered a balk.,modern
"I knew your pain, and it broke",modern
"My fine, craftsman's nerve;",modern
"Your body quailed at my stroke,",modern
And my courage failed to give you the last,modern
Fine torture you did deserve.,modern
"You are shapely, you are adorned,",modern
"But opaque and dull in the flesh,",modern
"Who, had I but pierced with the thorned",modern
"Fire-threshing anguish, were fused and cast",modern
In a lovely illumined mesh.,modern
Like a painted window: the best,modern
"Suffering burnt through your flesh,",modern
Undrossed it and left it blest,modern
With a quivering sweet wisdom of grace: but now,modern
Who shall take you afresh?,modern
Now who will burn you free,modern
"From your body's terrors and dross,",modern
Since the fire has failed in me?,modern
What man will stoop in your flesh to plough,modern
The shrieking cross?,modern
"A mute, nearly beautiful thing",modern
"Is your face, that fills me with shame",modern
"As I see it hardening,",modern
"Warping the perfect image of God,",modern
And darkening my eternal fame.,modern
Version 2 (1928),modern
"Yours is the sullen sorrow,",modern
The disgrace is also mine;,modern
"Your love was intense and thorough,",modern
Mine was the love of a growing flower,modern
For the sunshine.,modern
"You had the power to explore me,",modern
Blossom me stalk by stalk;,modern
"You woke my spirit, you bore me",modern
"To consciousness, you gave me the dour",modern
Awareness  then I suffered a balk.,modern
Body to body I could not,modern
"Love you, although I would.",modern
"We kissed, we kissed though we should not.",modern
"You yielded, we threw the last cast,",modern
And it was no good.,modern
"You only endured, and it broke",modern
My craftsman's nerve.,modern
No flesh responded to my stroke;,modern
So I failed to give you the last,modern
Fine torture you did deserve.,modern
"You are shapely, you are adorned",modern
But opaque and null in the flesh;,modern
"Who, had I but pierced with the thorned",modern
"Full anguish, perhaps had been cast",modern
In a lovely illuinined mesh,modern
Like a painted window; the best,modern
"Fire passed through your flesh,",modern
"Undrossed it, and left it blest",modern
In clean new awareness. But now,modern
Who shall take you afresh?,modern
Now who will burn you free,modern
From your body's deadness and dross?,modern
"Since the fire has failed in me,",modern
What man will stoop in your flesh to plough,modern
The shrieking cross?,modern
"A mute, nearly beautiful thing",modern
"Is your face, that fills me with shame",modern
As I see it hardening;,modern
I should have been cruel enough to bring,modern
"You through the flame.Strephon kissed me in the spring,",modern
"Robin in the fall,",modern
But Colin only looked at me,modern
And never kissed at all.,modern
"Strephon's kiss was lost in jest,",modern
"Robin's lost in play,",modern
But the kiss in Colin's eyes,modern
"Haunts me night and day.Let us go then, you and I,",modern
When the evening is spread out against the sky,modern
Like a patient etherized upon a table;,modern
"Let us go, through certain half-deserted streets,",modern
The muttering retreats,modern
Of restless nights in one-night cheap hotels,modern
And sawdust restaurants with oyster-shells:,modern
Streets that follow like a tedious argument,modern
Of insidious intent,modern
To lead you to an overwhelming question ...,modern
"Oh, do not ask, What is it?",modern
Let us go and make our visit.,modern
In the room the women come and go,modern
Talking of Michelangelo.,modern
"The yellow fog that rubs its back upon the window-panes,",modern
"The yellow smoke that rubs its muzzle on the window-panes,",modern
"Licked its tongue into the corners of the evening,",modern
"Lingered upon the pools that stand in drains,",modern
"Let fall upon its back the soot that falls from chimneys,",modern
"Slipped by the terrace, made a sudden leap,",modern
"And seeing that it was a soft October night,",modern
"Curled once about the house, and fell asleep.",modern
And indeed there will be time,modern
"For the yellow smoke that slides along the street,",modern
Rubbing its back upon the window-panes;,modern
"There will be time, there will be time",modern
To prepare a face to meet the faces that you meet;,modern
"There will be time to murder and create,",modern
And time for all the works and days of hands,modern
That lift and drop a question on your plate;,modern
"Time for you and time for me,",modern
"And time yet for a hundred indecisions,",modern
"And for a hundred visions and revisions,",modern
Before the taking of a toast and tea.,modern
In the room the women come and go,modern
Talking of Michelangelo.,modern
And indeed there will be time,modern
"To wonder, Do I dare? and, Do I dare?",modern
"Time to turn back and descend the stair,",modern
With a bald spot in the middle of my hair ,modern
(They will say: How his hair is growing thin!),modern
"My morning coat, my collar mounting firmly to the chin,",modern
"My necktie rich and modest, but asserted by a simple pin ",modern
(They will say: But how his arms and legs are thin!),modern
Do I dare,modern
Disturb the universe?,modern
In a minute there is time,modern
For decisions and revisions which a minute will reverse.,modern
"For I have known them all already, known them all:",modern
"Have known the evenings, mornings, afternoons,",modern
I have measured out my life with coffee spoons;,modern
I know the voices dying with a dying fall,modern
Beneath the music from a farther room.,modern
So how should I presume?,modern
"And I have known the eyes already, known them all",modern
"The eyes that fix you in a formulated phrase,",modern
"And when I am formulated, sprawling on a pin,",modern
"When I am pinned and wriggling on the wall,",modern
Then how should I begin,modern
To spit out all the butt-ends of my days and ways?,modern
And how should I presume?,modern
"And I have known the arms already, known them all",modern
Arms that are braceleted and white and bare,modern
"(But in the lamplight, downed with light brown hair!)",modern
Is it perfume from a dress,modern
That makes me so digress?,modern
"Arms that lie along a table, or wrap about a shawl.",modern
And should I then presume?,modern
And how should I begin?,modern
"Shall I say, I have gone at dusk through narrow streets",modern
And watched the smoke that rises from the pipes,modern
"Of lonely men in shirt-sleeves, leaning out of windows? ...",modern
I should have been a pair of ragged claws,modern
Scuttling across the floors of silent seas.,modern
"And the afternoon, the evening, sleeps so peacefully!",modern
"Smoothed by long fingers,",modern
"Asleep ... tired ... or it malingers,",modern
"Stretched on the floor, here beside you and me.",modern
"Should I, after tea and cakes and ices,",modern
Have the strength to force the moment to its crisis?,modern
"But though I have wept and fasted, wept and prayed,",modern
"Though I have seen my head (grown slightly bald) brought in upon a platter,",modern
I am no prophet  and heres no great matter;,modern
"I have seen the moment of my greatness flicker,",modern
"And I have seen the eternal Footman hold my coat, and snicker,",modern
"And in short, I was afraid.",modern
"And would it have been worth it, after all,",modern
"After the cups, the marmalade, the tea,",modern
"Among the porcelain, among some talk of you and me,",modern
"Would it have been worth while,",modern
"To have bitten off the matter with a smile,",modern
To have squeezed the universe into a ball,modern
"To roll it towards some overwhelming question,",modern
"To say: I am Lazarus, come from the dead,",modern
"Come back to tell you all, I shall tell you all",modern
"If one, settling a pillow by her head",modern
Should say: That is not what I meant at all;,modern
"That is not it, at all.",modern
"And would it have been worth it, after all,",modern
"Would it have been worth while,",modern
"After the sunsets and the dooryards and the sprinkled streets,",modern
"After the novels, after the teacups, after the skirts that trail along the floor",modern
"And this, and so much more?",modern
It is impossible to say just what I mean!,modern
But as if a magic lantern threw the nerves in patterns on a screen:,modern
Would it have been worth while,modern
"If one, settling a pillow or throwing off a shawl,",modern
"And turning toward the window, should say:",modern
"That is not it at all,",modern
"That is not what I meant, at all.",modern
"No! I am not Prince Hamlet, nor was meant to be;",modern
"Am an attendant lord, one that will do",modern
"To swell a progress, start a scene or two,",modern
"Advise the prince; no doubt, an easy tool,",modern
"Deferential, glad to be of use,",modern
"Politic, cautious, and meticulous;",modern
"Full of high sentence, but a bit obtuse;",modern
"At times, indeed, almost ridiculous",modern
"Almost, at times, the Fool.",modern
I grow old ... I grow old ...,modern
I shall wear the bottoms of my trousers rolled.,modern
Shall I part my hair behind?   Do I dare to eat a peach?,modern
"I shall wear white flannel trousers, and walk upon the beach.",modern
"I have heard the mermaids singing, each to each.",modern
I do not think that they will sing to me.,modern
I have seen them riding seaward on the waves,modern
Combing the white hair of the waves blown back,modern
When the wind blows the water white and black.,modern
We have lingered in the chambers of the sea,modern
By sea-girls wreathed with seaweed red and brown,modern
"Till human voices wake us, and we drown.I went to the dances at Chandlerville,",modern
And played snap-out at Winchester.,modern
"One time we changed partners,",modern
"Driving home in the moonlight of middle June,",modern
And then I found Davis.,modern
"We were married and lived together for seventy years,",modern
"Enjoying, working, raising the twelve children,",modern
Eight of whom we lost,modern
Ere I had reached the age of sixty.,modern
"I spun, I wove, I kept the house, I nursed the sick,",modern
"I made the garden, and for holiday",modern
"Rambled over the fields where sang the larks,",modern
"And by Spoon River gathering many a shell,",modern
And many a flower and medicinal weed ,modern
"Shouting to the wooded hills, singing to the green valleys.",modern
"At ninety-six I had lived enough, that is all,",modern
And passed to a sweet repose.,modern
"What is this I hear of sorrow and weariness,",modern
"Anger, discontent and drooping hopes?",modern
"Degenerate sons and daughters,",modern
Life is too strong for you ,modern
"It takes life to love Life.Seen my lady home las' night,",modern
"Jump back, honey, jump back.",modern
"Hel' huh han' an' sque'z it tight,",modern
"Jump back, honey, jump back.",modern
"Hyeahd huh sigh a little sigh,",modern

An' a smile go flittin' by ,modern
"Jump back, honey, jump back.",modern
"Hyeahd de win' blow thoo de pine,",modern
"Jump back, honey, jump back.",modern
"Mockin'-bird was singin' fine,",modern
"Jump back, honey, jump back.",modern

"Jump back, honey, jump back.",modern
"Love me, honey, love me true?",modern
Love me well ez I love you?,modern

"'Twell de gals is ma'ied off,",modern
"It gwine keep on saggin' low.I saw her in a Broadway car,",modern
The woman I might grow to be;,modern
I felt my lover look at her,modern
And then turn suddenly to me.,modern
Her hair was dull and drew no light,modern
And yet its color was as mine;,modern
Her eyes were strangely like my eyes,modern
Tho' love had never made them shine.,modern
"Her body was a thing grown thin,",modern
Hungry for love that never came;,modern
Her soul was frozen in the dark,modern
Unwarmed forever by love's flame.,modern
I felt my lover look at her,modern
"And then turn suddenly to me, ",modern
His eyes were magic to defy,modern
The woman I shall never be.,modern
Just as my fingers on these keys,modern
"Make music, so the selfsame sounds",modern
"On my spirit make a music, too.",modern
"Music is feeling, then, not sound;",modern
"And thus it is that what I feel,",modern
"Here in this room, desiring you,",modern
"Thinking of your blue-shadowed silk,",modern
Is music. It is like the strain,modern
Waked in the elders by Susanna: ,modern
"Of a green evening, clear and warm,",modern
"She bathed in her still garden, while",modern
"The red-eyed elders, watching, felt",modern
The basses of their beings throb,modern
"In witching chords, and their thin blood",modern
Pulse pizzicati of Hosanna.,modern
"In the green water, clear and warm,",modern
Susanna lay.,modern
She searched,modern
"The touch of springs,",modern
And found,modern
Concealed imaginings.,modern
"She sighed,",modern
For so much melody.,modern
"Upon the bank, she stood",modern
In the cool,modern
Of spent emotions.,modern
"She felt, among the leaves,",modern
The dew,modern
Of old devotions.,modern
"She walked upon the grass,",modern
Still quavering.,modern
"The winds were like her maids,",modern
"On timid feet,",modern
"Fetching her woven scarves,",modern
Yet wavering.,modern
A breath upon her hand,modern
Muted the night.,modern
She turned,modern
"A cymbal crashed,",modern
And roaring horns.,modern
"Soon, with a noise like tambourines,",modern
Came her attendant Byzantines.,modern
They wondered why Susanna cried,modern
Against the elders by her side;,modern
"And as they whispered, the refrain",modern
Was like a willow swept by rain.,modern
"Anon, their lamps' uplifted flame",modern
Revealed Susanna and her shame.,modern
"And then, the simpering Byzantines",modern
"Fled, with a noise like tambourines.",modern
Beauty is momentary in the mind,modern
The fitful tracing of a portal;,modern
But in the flesh it is immortal.,modern
The body dies; the body's beauty lives.,modern
"So evenings die, in their green going,",modern
"A wave, interminably flowing.",modern
"So gardens die, their meek breath scenting",modern
"The cowl of winter, done repenting.",modern
"So maidens die, to the auroral",modern
Celebration of a maiden's choral.,modern
Susanna's music touched the bawdy strings,modern
"Of those white elders; but, escaping,",modern
Left only Death's ironic scraping.,modern
"Now, in its immortality, it plays",modern
"On the clear viol of her memory,",modern
And makes a constant sacrament of praise.I,modern
Among the smoke and fog of a December afternoon,modern
You have the scene arrange itself  as it will seem to do,modern
"With ""I have saved this afternoon for you"";",modern
"And four wax candles in the darkened room,",modern
"Four rings of light upon the ceiling overhead,",modern
An atmosphere of Juliet's tomb,modern
"Prepared for all the things to be said, or left unsaid.",modern
"We have been, let us say, to hear the latest Pole",modern
"Transmit the Preludes, through his hair and finger-tips.",modern
"So intimate, this Chopin, that I think his soul
Should be resurrected only among friends
Some two or three, who will not touch the bloom
That is rubbed and questioned in the concert room.",modern
And so the conversation slips,modern
Among velleities and carefully caught regrets,modern
Through attenuated tones of violins,modern
Mingled with remote cornets,modern
And begins.,modern
"You do not know how much they mean to me, my friends,",modern
"And how, how rare and strange it is, to find",modern
"In a life composed so much, so much of odds and ends,",modern
(For indeed I do not love it ... you knew? you are not blind!,modern
How keen you are!),modern
"To find a friend who has these qualities,",modern
"Who has, and gives",modern
Those qualities upon which friendship lives.,modern
How much it means that I say this to you ,modern
"Without these friendships  life, what cauchemar!",modern
Among the winding of the violins,modern
And the ariettes,modern
Of cracked cornets,modern
Inside my brain a dull tom-tom begins,modern
"Absurdly hammering a prelude of its own,",modern
Capricious monotone,modern
"That is at least one definite ""false note.""",modern
" Let us take the air, in a tobacco trance,",modern
"Admire the monuments,",modern
"Discuss the late events,",modern
Correct our watches by the public clocks.,modern
Then sit for half an hour and drink our bocks.,modern
Now that lilacs are in bloom,modern
She has a bowl of lilacs in her room,modern
And twists one in her fingers while she talks.,modern
"Ah, my friend, you do not know, you do not know
What life is, you who hold it in your hands;",modern
(Slowly twisting the lilac stalks),modern
"You let it flow from you, you let it flow,
And youth is cruel, and has no remorse
And smiles at situations which it cannot see.",modern
"I smile, of course,",modern
And go on drinking tea.,modern
"Yet with these April sunsets, that somehow recall",modern
"My buried life, and Paris in the Spring,",modern
"I feel immeasurably at peace, and find the world",modern
"To be wonderful and youthful, after all.",modern
The voice returns like the insistent out-of-tune,modern
Of a broken violin on an August afternoon:,modern
I am always sure that you understand,modern
"My feelings, always sure that you feel,",modern
Sure that across the gulf you reach your hand.,modern
"You are invulnerable, you have no Achilles' heel.",modern
"You will go on, and when you have prevailed",modern
You can say: at this point many a one has failed.,modern
"But what have I, but what have I, my friend,",modern
"To give you, what can you receive from me?",modern
Only the friendship and the sympathy,modern
Of one about to reach her journey's end.,modern
"I shall sit here, serving tea to friends ....",modern
I take my hat: how can I make a cowardly amends,modern
For what she has said to me?,modern
You will see me any morning in the park,modern
Reading the comics and the sporting page.,modern
Particularly I remark.,modern
An English countess goes upon the stage.,modern
"A Greek was murdered at a Polish dance,",modern
Another bank defaulter has confessed.,modern
"I keep my countenance,",modern
I remain self-possessed,modern
"Except when a street-piano, mechanical and tired",modern
Reiterates some worn-out common song,modern
With the smell of hyacinths across the garden,modern
Recalling things that other people have desired.,modern
Are these ideas right or wrong?,modern
The October night comes down; returning as before,modern
Except for a slight sensation of being ill at ease,modern
I mount the stairs and turn the handle of the door,modern
And feel as if I had mounted on my hands and knees.,modern
And so you are going abroad; and when do you return?,modern
But that's a useless question.,modern
"You hardly know when you are coming back,",modern
You will find so much to learn.,modern
My smile falls heavily among the bric-a-brac.,modern
Perhaps you can write to me.,modern
My self-possession flares up for a second;,modern
This is as I had reckoned.,modern
"I have been wondering frequently of late
(But our beginnings never know our ends!)
Why we have not developed into friends.",modern
"I feel like one who smiles, and turning shall remark",modern
"Suddenly, his expression in a glass.",modern
My self-possession gutters; we are really in the dark.,modern
"For everybody said so, all our friends,",modern
They all were sure our feelings would relate,modern
So closely! I myself can hardly understand.,modern
We must leave it now to fate.,modern
"You will write, at any rate.",modern
Perhaps it is not too late.,modern
"I shall sit here, serving tea to friends.",modern
And I must borrow every changing shape,modern
"To find expression ... dance, dance",modern
"Like a dancing bear,",modern
"Cry like a parrot, chatter like an ape.",modern
"Let us take the air, in a tobacco trance",modern
"Well! and what if she should die some afternoon,",modern
"Afternoon grey and smoky, evening yellow and rose;",modern
Should die and leave me sitting pen in hand,modern
With the smoke coming down above the housetops;,modern
"Doubtful, for quite a while",modern
Not knowing what to feel or if I understand,modern
"Or whether wise or foolish, tardy or too soon ...",modern
"Would she not have the advantage, after all?",modern
"This music is successful with a ""dying fall""",modern
Now that we talk of dying,modern
"And should I have the right to smile?Maurice, weep not, I am not here under this pine tree.",modern
"The balmy air of spring whispers through the sweet grass,",modern
"The stars sparkle, the whippoorwill calls,",modern
"But thou grievest, while my soul lies rapturous",modern
In the blest Nirvana of eternal light!,modern
"Go to the good heart that is my husband,",modern
Who broods upon what he calls our guilty love: i,modern
"Tell him that my love for you, no less than my love for him",modern
Wrought out my destiny i that through the flesh,modern
"I won spirit, and through spirit, peace.",modern
"There is no marriage in heaven,",modern
But there is love.I shall not go with pain,modern
"Whether you hold me, whether you forget",modern
My little loss and my immortal gain.,modern
"O flower unseen, O fountain sealed apart!",modern
"Give me one look, one look remembering yet,",modern
Sweet heart.,modern
"I shall not go with grief,",modern
"Whether you call me, whether you deny",modern
The crowning vintage and the golden sheaf.,modern
"O, April hopes that blossom but to close!",modern
"Give me one look, one look and so good-bye,",modern
Red rose.,modern
"I shall not go with sighs,",modern
"But as full-crowned the warrior leaves the fight,",modern
Dawn on his shield and death upon his eyes.,modern
"O, life so bitter-sweet and heaven so far!",modern
"Give me one look, one look and so good night,",modern
"My star.Wintah, summah, snow er shine,",modern
"Hit's all de same to me,",modern
"Ef only I kin call you mine,",modern
An' keep you by my knee.,modern
"Ha'dship, frolic, grief er caih,",modern
"Content by night an' day,",modern
Ef only I kin see you whaih,modern
You wait beside de way.,modern
"Livin', dyin', smiles er teahs,",modern
"My soul will still be free,",modern
Ef only thoo de comin' yeahs,modern
You walk de worl' wid me.,modern
"Bird-song, breeze-wail, chune er moan,",modern
"What puny t'ings dey'll be,",modern
"Ef w'en I's seemin' all erlone,",modern
I knows yo' hea't's wid me.This youth too long has heard the break,modern
Of waters in a land of change.,modern
He goes to see what suns can make,modern
From soil more indurate and strange.,modern
He cuts what holds his days together,modern
"And shuts him in, as lock on lock:",modern
"The arrowed vane announcing weather,",modern
The tripping racket of a clock;,modern
"Seeking, I think, a light that waits",modern
"Still as a lamp upon a shelf, ",modern
A land with hills like rocky gates,modern
Where no sea leaps upon itself.,modern
But he will find that nothing dares,modern
"To be enduring, save where, south",modern
"Of hidden deserts, torn fire glares",modern
"On beauty with a rusted mouth, ",modern
Where something dreadful and another,modern
Look quietly upon each other.Making his advances,modern
"He does not look at her, nor sniff at her,",modern
"No, not even sniff at her, his nose is blank.",modern
Only he senses the vulnerable folds of skin,modern
That work beneath her while she sprawls along,modern
"In her ungainly pace,",modern
Her folds of skin that work and row,modern
Beneath the earth-soiled hovel in which she moves.,modern
And so he strains beneath her housey walls,modern
And catches her trouser-legs in his beak,modern
"Suddenly, or her skinny limb,",modern
And strange and grimly drags at her,modern
"Like a dog,",modern
"Only agelessly silent, with a reptile's awful persistency.",modern
"Grim, gruesome gallantry, to which he is doomed.",modern
Dragged out of an eternity of silent isolation,modern
"And doomed to partiality, partial being,",modern
"Ache, and want of being,",modern
"Want,",modern
"Self-exposure, hard humiliation, need to add himself on to her.",modern
"Born to walk alone,",modern
"Forerunner,",modern
"Now suddenly distracted into this mazy side-track,",modern
"This awkward, harrowing pursuit,",modern
This grim necessity from within.,modern
Does she know,modern
As she moves eternally slowly away?,modern
"Or is he driven against her with a bang, like a bird flying in the dark against a window,",modern
All knowledgeless?,modern
"The awful concussion,",modern
"And the still more awful need to persist, to follow, follow, continue,",modern
"Driven, after ons of pristine, fore-god-like singleness and oneness,",modern
"At the end of some mysterious, red-hot iron,",modern
"Driven away from himself into her tracks,",modern
Forced to crash against her.,modern
"Stiff, gallant, irascible, crook-legged reptile,",modern
"Little gentleman,",modern
"Sorry plight,",modern
We ought to look the other way.,modern
"Save that, having come with you so far,",modern
"We will go on to the end.I thought he was dumb,",modern
"I said he was dumb,",modern
Yet I've heard him cry.,modern
"First faint scream,",modern
"Out of life's unfathomable dawn,",modern
"Far off, so far, like a madness, under the horizon's dawning rim,",modern
"Far, far off, far scream.",modern
Tortoise in extremis.,modern
Why were we crucified into sex?,modern
"Why were we not left rounded off, and finished in ourselves,",modern
"As we began,",modern
"As he certainly began, so perfectly alone?",modern
"A far, was-it-audible scream,",modern
Or did it sound on the plasm direct?,modern
"Worse than the cry of the new-born,",modern
"A scream,",modern
"A yell,",modern
"A shout,",modern
"A pan,",modern
"A death-agony,",modern
"A birth-cry,",modern
"A submission,",modern
"All tiny, tiny, far away, reptile under the first dawn.",modern
"War-cry, triumph, acute-delight, death-scream reptilian,",modern
Why was the veil torn?,modern
The silken shriek of the soul's torn membrane?,modern
The male soul's membrane,modern
"Torn with a shriek half music, half horror.",modern
Crucifixion.,modern
"Male tortoise, cleaving behind the hovel-wall of that dense female,",modern
"Mounted and tense, spread-eagle, out-reaching out of the shell",modern
"In tortoise-nakedness,",modern
"Long neck, and long vulnerable limbs extruded, spread-eagle over her house-roof,",modern
"And the deep, secret, all-penetrating tail curved beneath her walls,",modern
"Reaching and gripping tense, more reaching anguish in uttermost tension",modern
"Till suddenly, in the spasm of coition, tupping like a jerking leap, and oh!",modern
Opening its clenched face from his outstretched neck,modern
"And giving that fragile yell, that scream,",modern
"Super-audible,",modern
"From his pink, cleft, old-man's mouth,",modern
"Giving up the ghost,",modern
"Or screaming in Pentecost, receiving the ghost.",modern
"His scream, and his moment's subsidence,",modern
"The moment of eternal silence,",modern
"Yet unreleased, and after the moment, the sudden, startling jerk of coition, and at once",modern
The inexpressible faint yell ,modern
"And so on, till the last plasm of my body was melted back",modern
"To the primeval rudiments of life, and the secret.",modern
"So he tups, and screams",modern
"Time after time that frail, torn scream",modern
"After each jerk, the longish interval,",modern
"The tortoise eternity,",modern
"Agelong, reptilian persistence,",modern
"Heart-throb, slow heart-throb, persistent for the next spasm.",modern
"I remember, when I was a boy,",modern
"I heard the scream of a frog, which was caught with his foot in the mouth of an up-starting snake;",modern
I remember when I first heard bull-frogs break into sound in the spring;,modern
I remember hearing a wild goose out of the throat of night,modern
"Cry loudly, beyond the lake of waters;",modern
"I remember the first time, out of a bush in the darkness, a nightingale's piercing cries and gurgles startled the depths of my soul;",modern
I remember the scream of a rabbit as I went through a wood at midnight;,modern
"I remember the heifer in her heat, blorting and blorting through the hours, persistent and irrepressible;",modern
"I remember my first terror hearing the howl of weird, amorous cats;",modern
"I remember the scream of a terrified, injured horse, the sheet-lightning",modern
"And running away from the sound of a woman in labor, something like an owl whooing,",modern
"And listening inwardly to the first bleat of a lamb,",modern
"The first wail of an infant,",modern
"And my mother singing to herself,",modern
"And the first tenor singing of the passionate throat of a young collier, who has long since drunk himself to death,",modern
The first elements of foreign speech,modern
On wild dark lips.,modern
"And more than all these,",modern
"And less than all these,",modern
"This last,",modern
"Strange, faint coition yell",modern
"Of the male tortoise at extremity,",modern
Tiny from under the very edge of the farthest far-off horizon of life.,modern
"The cross,",modern
"The wheel on which our silence first is broken,",modern
"Sex, which breaks up our integrity, our single inviolability, our deep silence",modern
Tearing a cry from us.,modern
"Sex, which breaks us into voice, sets us calling across the deeps, calling, calling for the complement,",modern
"Singing, and calling, and singing again, being answered, having found.",modern
"Torn, to become whole again, after long seeking for what is lost,",modern
"The same cry from the tortoise as from Christ, the Osiris-cry of abandonment,",modern
"That which is whole, torn asunder,",modern
"That which is in part, finding its whole again throughout the universe. With the man I love who loves me not,",modern
I walked in the street-lamps' flare;,modern
We watched the world go home that night,modern
In a flood through Union Square.,modern
I leaned to catch the words he said,modern
That were light as a snowflake falling;,modern
Ah well that he never leaned to hear,modern
The words my heart was calling.,modern
And on we walked and on we walked,modern
Past the fiery lights of the picture shows ,modern
Where the girls with thirsty eyes go by,modern
On the errand each man knows.,modern
"And on we walked and on we walked,",modern
At the door at last we said good-bye;,modern
I knew by his smile he had not heard,modern
My heart's unuttered cry.,modern
With the man I love who loves me not,modern
I walked in the street-lamps' flare ,modern
"But oh, the girls who ask for love",modern
In the lights of Union Square.,modern
"When you are old and grey and full of sleep,",modern
"And nodding by the fire, take down this book,",modern
"And slowly read, and dream of the soft look",modern
"Your eyes had once, and of their shadows deep;",modern
"How many loved your moments of glad grace,",modern
"And loved your beauty with love false or true,",modern
"But one man loved the pilgrim soul in you,",modern
And loved the sorrows of your changing face;,modern
"And bending down beside the glowing bars,",modern
"Murmur, a little sadly, how Love fled",modern
And paced upon the mountains overhead,modern
"And hid his face amid a crowd of stars.Give me hunger,",modern
O you gods that sit and give,modern
The world its orders.,modern
"Give me hunger, pain and want,",modern
Shut me out with shame and failure,modern
"From your doors of gold and fame,",modern
"Give me your shabbiest, weariest hunger!",modern
"But leave me a little love,",modern
"A voice to speak to me in the day end,",modern
A hand to touch me in the dark room,modern
Breaking the long loneliness.,modern
In the dusk of day-shapes,modern
"Blurring the sunset,",modern
"One little wandering, western star",modern
Thrust out from the changing shores of shadow.,modern
"Let me go to the window,",modern
Watch there the day-shapes of dusk,modern
And wait and know the coming,modern
"Of a little love.Potuia, potuia",modern
"White grave goddess,",modern
"Pity my sadness,",modern
O silence of Paros.,modern
"I am not of these about thy feet,",modern
These garments and decorum;,modern
"I am thy brother,",modern
"Thy lover of aforetime crying to thee,",modern
And thou hearest me not.,modern
I have whispered thee in thy solitudes,modern
"Of our loves in Phrygia,",modern
The far ecstasy of burning noons,modern
When the fragile pipes,modern
"Ceased in the cypress shade,",modern
And the brown fingers of the shepherd,modern
Moved over slim shoulders;,modern
And only the cicada sang.,modern
I have told thee of the hills,modern
And the lisp of reeds,modern
"And the sun upon thy breasts,",modern
"And thou hearest me not,",modern
"Potuia, potuia",modern
Thou hearest me not.,modern
"I leaned against the mantel, sick, sick,",modern
"Thinking of my failure, looking into the abysm,",modern
Weak from the noon-day heat.,modern
"A church bell sounded mournfully far away,",modern
"I heard the cry of a baby,",modern
"And the coughing of John Yarnell,",modern
"Bed-ridden, feverish, feverish, dying,",modern
Then the violent voice of my wife:,modern
"Watch out, the potatoes are burning!",modern
I smelled them ... then there was irresistible disgust.,modern
I pulled the trigger ... blackness ... light ...,modern
Unspeakable regret ... fumbling for the world again.,modern
"Too late! Thus I came here,",modern
"With lungs for breathing ... one cannot breathe here with lungs,",modern
Though one must breathe,modern
"Of what use is it To rid one's self of the world,",modern
When no soul may ever escape the eternal destiny of life?I was the first fruits of the battle of Missionary Ridge.,modern
When I felt the bullet enter my heart,modern
I wished I had staid at home and gone to jail,modern
"For stealing the hogs of Curl Trenary,",modern
Instead of running away and joining the army.,modern
Rather a thousand times the county jail,modern
"Than to lie under this marble figure with wings,",modern
"And this granite pedestal Bearing the words, Pro Patria.",modern
"What do they mean, anyway?I was only eight years old;",modern
And before I grew up and knew what it meant,modern
"I had no words for it, except",modern
That I was frightened and told my,modern
Mother; And that my Father got a pistol,modern
"And would have killed Charlie, who was a big boy,",modern
"Fifteen years old, except for his Mother.",modern
Nevertheless the story clung to me.,modern
"But the man who married me, a widower of thirty-five,",modern
Was a newcomer and never heard it,modern
Till two years after we were married.,modern
"Then he considered himself cheated,",modern
And the village agreed that I was not really a virgin.,modern
"Well, he deserted me, and I died",modern
The following winter.,modern
Why should I blame her that she filled my days,modern
"With misery, or that she would of late",modern
"Have taught to ignorant men most violent ways,",modern
"Or hurled the little streets upon the great,",modern
Had they but courage equal to desire?,modern
What could have made her peaceful with a mind,modern
"That nobleness made simple as a fire,",modern
"With beauty like a tightened bow, a kind",modern
"That is not natural in an age like this,",modern
Being high and solitary and most stern?,modern
"Why, what could she have done, being what she is?",modern
Was there another Troy for her to burn?I ,modern
GLOOM! ,modern
An October like November; ,modern
"August a hundred thousand hours, ",modern
"And all September, ",modern
"A hundred thousand, dragging sunlit days, ",modern
And half October like a thousand years . . . ,modern
And doom! ,modern
That then was Antwerp. . . ,modern
"In the name of God, ",modern
How could they do it? ,modern
Those souls that usually dived ,modern
Into the dirty caverns of mines; ,modern
Who usually hived ,modern
In whitened hovels; under ragged poplars; ,modern
"Who dragged muddy shovels, over the grassy mud, ",modern
Lumbering to work over the greasy sods. . . ,modern
"Those men there, with the appearance of clods ",modern
Were the bravest men that a usually listless priest of God ,modern
Ever shrived. . . ,modern
And it is not for us to make them an anthem. ,modern
If we found words there would come no wind that would fan them ,modern
"To a tune that the trumpets might blow it, ",modern
"Shrill through the heaven that's ours or yet Allah's, ",modern
Or the wide halls of any Valhallas. ,modern
We can make no such anthem. So that all that is ours ,modern
"For inditing in sonnets, pantoums, elegiacs, or lays ",modern
"In the name of God, how could they do it? ",modern
"For there is no new thing under the sun, ",modern
Only this uncomely man with a smoking gun ,modern
In the gloom. . . ,modern
What the devil will he gain by it? ,modern
Digging a hole in the mud and standing all day in the rain by it ,modern
Waiting his doom; ,modern
"The sharp blow, the swift outpouring of the blood, ",modern
Till the trench of gray mud ,modern
Is turned to a brown purple drain by it. ,modern
"Well, there have been scars ",modern
Won in many wars . . .,modern
"Punic, ",modern
"Lacedmonian, wars of Napoleon, wars for faith, wars for honour, for love, for possession, ",modern
"But this Belgian man in his ugly tunic, ",modern
"His ugly round cap, shooting on, in a sort of obsession, ",modern
"Overspreading his miserable land, ",modern
Standing with his wet gun in his hand . . . ,modern
Doom! ,modern
"He finds that in a sudden scrimmage, ",modern
"And lies, an unsightly lump on the sodden grass . . . ",modern
An image that shall take long to pass! ,modern
For the white-limbed heroes of Hellas ride by upon their horses ,modern
Forever through our brains. ,modern
The heroes of Cressy ride by upon their stallions; ,modern
And battalions and battalions and battalions ,modern
"The Old Guard, the Young Guard, the men of Minden and of Waterloo, ",modern
"Pass, for ever staunch, ",modern
"Stand, for ever true; ",modern
"And the small man with the large paunch, ",modern
"And the gray coat, and the large hat, and the hands behind the back, ",modern
Watches them pass ,modern
In our minds for ever . . . ,modern
But that clutter of sodden corses ,modern
On the sodden Belgian grass ,modern
That is a strange new beauty. ,modern
"With no especial legends of marchings or triumphs or duty, ",modern
"Assuredly that is the way of it, ",modern
The way of beauty . . . ,modern
And that is the highest word you can find to say of it. ,modern
For you cannot praise it with words ,modern
"Compounded of lyres and swords, ",modern
But the thought of the gloom and the rain ,modern
"And the ugly coated figure, standing beside a drain, ",modern
Shall eat itself into your brain: ,modern
"And you will say of all heroes, They fought like the Belgians! ",modern
And you will say: He wrought like a Belgian his fate out of gloom. ,modern
And you will say: He bought like a Belgian his doom. ,modern
And that shall be an honourable name; ,modern
Belgian shall be an honourable word; ,modern
"As honourable as the fame of the sword, ",modern
"As honourable as the mention of the many-chorded lyre, ",modern
And his old coat shall seem as beautiful as the fabrics woven in Tyre. ,modern
And what in the world did they bear it for? ,modern
I don't know. ,modern
And what in the world did they dare it for? ,modern
Perhaps that is not for the likes of me to understand. ,modern
They could very well have watched a hundred legions go ,modern
Over their fields and between their cities ,modern
Down into more southerly regions. ,modern
"They could very well have let the legions pass through their woods, ",modern
And have kept their lives and their wives and their children and cattle and goods. ,modern
I don't understand. ,modern
Was it just love of their land? ,modern
"Oh, poor dears! ",modern
Can any man so love his land? ,modern
Give them a thousand thousand pities ,modern
And rivers and rivers of tears ,modern
To wash off the blood from the cities of Flanders. ,modern
This is Charing Cross; ,modern
It is midnight; ,modern
There is a great crowd ,modern
And no light. ,modern
"A great crowd, all black that hardly whispers aloud. ",modern
"Surely, that is a dead womana dead mother! ",modern
She has a dead face; ,modern
She is dressed all in black; ,modern
"She wanders to the bookstall and back, ",modern
At the back of the crowd; ,modern
"And back again and again back, ",modern
She sways and wanders. ,modern
This is Charing Cross; ,modern
It is one o'clock. ,modern
"There is still a great cloud, and very little light; ",modern
Immense shafts of shadows over the black crowd ,modern
That hardly whispers aloud. . . ,modern
"And now! .  . That is another dead mother, ",modern
And there is another and another and another. . . ,modern
"And little children, all in black, ",modern
"All with dead faces, waiting in all the waiting-places, ",modern
Wandering from the doors of the waiting-room ,modern
In the dim gloom. ,modern
These are the women of Flanders.,modern
They await the lost. ,modern
They await the lost that shall never leave the dock; ,modern
They await the lost that shall never again come by the train ,modern
To the embraces of all these women with dead faces; ,modern
"They await the lost who lie dead in trench and barrier and foss, ",modern
In the dark of the night. ,modern
This is Charing Cross; it is past one of the clock; ,modern
There is very little light. ,modern
There is so much pain. ,modern
And it was for this that they endured this gloom; ,modern
"This October like November, ",modern
"That August like a hundred thousand hours, ",modern
"And that September, ",modern
"A hundred thousand dragging sunlit days, ",modern
And half October like a thousand years. . . ,modern
"Oh, poor dears!As I went up by Ovillers",modern
"In mud and water cold to the knee,",modern
"There went three jeering, fleering spectres,",modern
That walked abreast and talked of me.,modern
"The first said, Heres a right brave soldier",modern
That walks the dark unfearingly;,modern
"Soon hell come back on a fine stretcher,",modern
And laughing for a nice Blighty.,modern
"The second, Read his face, old comrade,",modern
No kind of lucky chance I see;,modern
"One day hell freeze in mud to the marrow,",modern
Then look his last on Picardie.,modern
Though bitter the word of these first twain,modern
Curses the third spat venomously;,modern
Hell stay untouched till the wars last dawning,modern
Then live one hour of agony.,modern
Liars the first two were. Behold me,modern
At sloping arms by one  two  three;,modern
Waiting the time I shall discover,modern
Whether the third spake verity.She was a village,modern
Of lovely knowledge,modern
"The high roads left her aside, she was forlorn, a maid ",modern
"Water ran there, dusk hid her, she climbed four-wayed.",modern
Brown-gold windows showed last folk not yet asleep;,modern
"Water ran, was a centre of silence deep,",modern
"Fathomless deeps of pricked sky, almost fathomless",modern
Hallowed an upward gaze in pale satin of blue.,modern
"And I was happy indeed, of mind, soul, body even",modern
Having got given,modern
A sign undoubtful of a dear England few,modern
"Doubt, not many have seen,",modern
That Will Squele he knew and was so shriven.,modern
"Home of Twelfth Night  Edward Thomas by Arras fallen,",modern
"Borrow and Hardy, Sussex tales out of Roman heights callen.",modern
No madrigals or field-songs to my all reverent whim;,modern
"Till I got back I was dumb.If it were not for England, who would bear",modern
This heavy servitude one moment more?,modern
"To keep a brothel, sweep and wash the floor",modern
Of filthiest hovels were noble to compare,modern
"With this brass-cleaning life. Now here, now there",modern
"Harried in foolishness, scanned curiously o'er",modern
"By fools made brazen by conceit, and store",modern
Of antique witticisms thin and bare.,modern
"Only the love of comrades sweetens all,",modern
Whose laughing spirit will not be outdone.,modern
As night-watching men wait for the sun,modern
"To hearten them, so wait I on such boys",modern
"As neither brass nor Hell-fire may appal,",modern
"Nor guns, nor sergeant-major's bluster and noise.Only the wanderer",modern
"Knows England's graces,",modern
Or can anew see clear,modern
Familiar faces.,modern
And who loves joy as he,modern
That dwells in shadows?,modern
"Do not forget me quite,",modern
"O Severn meadows.Little did I dream, England, that you bore me",modern
"Under the Cotswold hills beside the water meadows,",modern
"To do you dreadful service, here, beyond your borders",modern
And your enfolding seas.,modern
"I was a dreamer ever, and bound to your dear service,",modern
"Meditating deep, I thought on your secret beauty,",modern
As through a child's face one may see the clear spirit,modern
Miraculously shining.,modern
"Your hills not only hills, but friends of mine and kindly,",modern
Your tiny knolls and orchards hidden beside the river,modern
"Muddy and strongly flowing, with shy and tiny streamlets",modern
Safe in its bosom.,modern
"Now these are memories only, and your skies and rushy sky-pools",modern
Fragile mirrors easily broken by moving airs ...,modern
"But deep in my heart for ever goes on your daily being,",modern
And uses consecrate.,modern
"Think on me too, O Mother, who wrest my soul to serve you",modern
In strange and fearful ways beyond your encircling waters;,modern
"None but you can know my heart, its tears and sacrifice;",modern
"None, but you, repay.He's gone, and all our plans",modern
Are useless indeed.,modern
We'll walk no more on Cotswold,modern
Where the sheep feed,modern
Quietly and take no heed.,modern
His body that was so quick,modern
Is not as you,modern
"Knew it, on Severn river",modern
Under the blue,modern
Driving our small boat through.,modern
You would not know him now ...,modern
But still he died,modern
"Nobly, so cover him over",modern
With violets of pride,modern
Purple from Severn side.,modern
"Cover him, cover him soon!",modern
And with thick-set,modern
Masses of memoried flowers,modern
Hide that red wet,modern
"Thing I must somehow forget.Now, youth, the hour of thy dread passion comes;",modern
Thy lovely things must all be laid away;,modern
"And thou, as others, must face the riven day",modern
"Unstirred by rattle of the rolling drums,",modern
Or bugles' strident cry. When mere noise numbs,modern
"The sense of being, the sick soul doth sway,",modern
"Remember thy great craft's honour, that they may say",modern
Nothing in shame of poets. Then the crumbs,modern
Of praise the little versemen joyed to take,modern
"Shall be forgotten; then they must know we are,",modern
"For all our skill in words, equal in might",modern
And strong of mettle as those we honoured; make,modern
"The name of poet terrible in just war,",modern
And like a crown of honour upon the fight.When I remember plain heroic strength,modern
"And shining virtue shown by Ypres pools,",modern
Then read the blither written by knaves for fools,modern
"In praise of English soldiers lying at length,",modern
Who purely dream what England shall be made,modern
"Gloriously new, free of the old stains",modern
"By us, who pay the price that must be paid,",modern
Will freeze all winter over Ypres plains.,modern
Our silly dreams of peace you put aside,modern
"And brotherhood of man, for you will see",modern
"An armed mistress, braggart of the tide,",modern
"Her children slaves, under your mastery.",modern
"We'll have a word there too, and forge a knife,",modern
Will cut the cancer threatens England's life.,modern
"So in Pieria, from the wedded bliss",modern
"Of Time and Memory, the Muses came",modern
"To be the means of rich oblivion,",modern
And rest from cares.  And when the Thunderer,modern
"Took heaven, then the Titans warred on him",modern
"For pity of mankind. But the great law,",modern
"Which is the law of music, not of bread,",modern
"Set Atlas for a pillar, manacled",modern
"His brother to the rocks of the Scythia,",modern
And under Aetna fixed the furious Typhon.,modern
"So should thought rule, not force. And Amphion,",modern
"Pursuing justice, entered Thebes and slew",modern
His mother's spouse; but when he would make sure,modern
"And fortify the city, then he took",modern
"The lyre that Hermes gave, and played, and watched",modern
"The stones move and assemble, till a wall",modern
Engirded Thebes and kept the citadel,modern
Beyond the reach of arrows and of fire.,modern
What other power but harmony can build,modern
"A city, and what gift so magical",modern
As that by which a city lifts its walls?,modern
"So men, in years to come, shall feel the power",modern
Of this man moving through the high-ranged thought,modern
"Which plans for beauty, builds for larger life.",modern
The stones shall rise in towers to answer him.My bands of silk and miniver,modern
Momently grew heavier;,modern
The black gauze was beggarly thin;,modern
The ermine muffled mouth and chin;,modern
I could not suck the moonlight in.,modern
Harlequin in lozenges,modern
"Of love and hate, I walked in these",modern
Striped and ragged rigmaroles;,modern
Along the pavement my footsoles,modern
Trod warily on living coals.,modern
"Shouldering the thoughts I loathed,",modern
"In their corrupt disguises clothed,",modern
Morality I could not tear,modern
"From my ribs, to leave them bare",modern
Ivory in silver air.,modern
"There I walked, and there I raged;",modern
The spiritual savage caged,modern
"Within my skeleton, raged afresh",modern
"To feel, behind a carnal mesh,",modern
The clean bones crying in the flesh.,modern
"Behoild Pelides with his yellow hair,",modern
"Proud child of Thetis, hero loved of Jove;",modern
Above the frowning of his brows of wove,modern
"A crown of gold, well combed, with Spartan care.",modern
"Who might have seen him, sullen, great, and fair,",modern
"As with the wrongful world he proudly strove,",modern
"And by high deeds his wilder passion shrove,",modern
"Mastering love, resentment, and despair.",modern
"He knew his end, and Phoebus arrow sure",modern
"He braved for fame immortal and a friend,",modern
"Despising life; and we, who know our end,",modern
Know that in our decay he shall endure,modern
"And all our childrens hearts to grief inure,",modern
With whose first bitter battles his shall blend.,modern
"Who brought thee forth, immortal vision, who",modern
In Phthia or in Tempe brought thee forth?,modern
Out of the sunlight and the sapful earth,modern
What god the simples of thy spirit drew?,modern
"A goddess rose from the green waves, and threw",modern
"Her arms about a king, to give thee birth;",modern
"A centaur, patron of thy boyish mirth,",modern
Over the meadows in thy footsteps flew.,modern
"Now Thessaly forgets thee, and the deep",modern
Thy keeled bark furrowed answers not thy prayer;,modern
But far away new generations keep,modern
Thy laurels fresh; where branching Isis hems,modern
"The lawns of Oxford round about, or where",modern
Enchanted Eton sits by pleasant Thames.,modern
I gaze on thee as Phidias of old,modern
"Or Polyclitus gazed, when first he saw",modern
"These hard and shining limbs, without a flaw,",modern
And cast his wonder in heroic mould.,modern
"Unhappy me who only may behold,",modern
Nor make immutable and fix in awe,modern
"A fair immortal form no worm shall gnaw,",modern
A tempered mind whose faith was never told!,modern
"The godlike mien, the lions lock and eye,",modern
"The well-knit sinew, utter a brave heart",modern
Better than many words that part by part,modern
Spell in strange symbols what serene and whole,modern
"In nature lives, nor can in marble die.",modern
The perfect body itself the soul.,modern
"I had come to the house, in a cave of trees,",modern
Facing a sheer sky.,modern
"Everything moved,a bell hung ready to strike,",modern
Sun and reflection wheeled by.,modern
When the bare eyes were before me,modern
"And the hissing hair,",modern
"Held up at a window, seen through a door.",modern
"The stiff bald eyes, the serpents on the forehead",modern
Formed in the air.,modern
This is a dead scene forever now.,modern
Nothing will ever stir.,modern
"The end will never brighten it more than this,",modern
Nor the rain blur.,modern
"The water will always fall, and will not fall,",modern
And the tipped bell make no sound.,modern
The grass will always be growing for hay,modern
Deep on the ground.,modern
And I shall stand here like a shadow,modern
"Under the great balanced day,",modern
"My eyes on the yellow dust, that was lifting in the wind,",modern
"And does not drift away.There may be chaos still around the world,",modern
This little world that in my thinking lies;,modern
For mine own bosom is the paradise,modern
Where all my lifes fair visions are unfurled.,modern
"Within my natures shell I slumber curled,",modern
"Unmindful of the changing outer skies,",modern
"Where now, perchance, some new-born Eros flies,",modern
Or some old Cronos from his throne is hurled.,modern
I heed them not; or if the subtle night,modern
"Haunt me with deities I never saw,",modern
I soon mine eyelids drowsy curtain draw,modern
To hide their myriad faces from my sight.,modern
They threat in vain; the whirlwind cannot awe,modern
A happy snow-flake dancing in the flaw.,modern
"Another's a half-cracked fellowJohn Heydon,",modern
"Worker of miracles, dealer in levitation,",modern
"In thoughts upon pure form, in alchemy,",modern
"Seer of pretty visions (""servant of God and secretary of nature"");",modern
"Full of plaintive charm, like Botticelli's,",modern
"With half-transparent forms, lacking the vigor of gods.",modern
"Thus Heydon, in a trance, at Bulverton,",modern
Had such a sight:,modern
"Decked all in green, with sleeves of yellow silk",modern
"Slit to the elbow, slashed with various purples.",modern
"Her eyes were green as glass, her foot was leaf-like.",modern
"She was adorned with choicest emeralds,",modern
And promised him the way of holy wisdom.,modern
"Pretty green bank, began the half-lost poem.",modern
"Take the old way, say I met John Heydon,",modern
"Sought out the place,",modern
"Lay on the bank, was ""plunged deep in swevyn;""",modern
"And saw the companyLayamon, Chaucer",modern
Pass each in his appropriate robes;,modern
"Conversed with each, observed the varying fashion.",modern
And then comes Heydon.,modern
I have seen John Heydon.,modern
Let us hear John Heydon!,modern
"Omnis intellectus est""thus he begins, by spouting half of Psellus.",modern
"(Then comes a note, my assiduous commentator:",modern
"Not Psellus De Daemonibus, but Porphyry's Chances,",modern
"In the thirteenth chapter, that ""every intellect is omni-form."")",modern
"Magnifico Lorenzo used the dodge,",modern
Says that he met Ficino,modern
"In some Wordsworthian, false-pastoral manner,",modern
"And that they walked along, stopped at a well-head,",modern
And heard deep platitudes about contentment,modern
From some old codger with an endless beard.,modern
"A daemon is not a particular intellect,
But is a substance differed from intellect,",modern
"Breaks in Ficino,",modern
Placed in the latitude or locus of souls,modern
"That's out of Proclus, take your pick of them.",modern
"Valla, more earth and sounder rhetoric",modern
Prefacing praise to his Pope Nicholas:,modern
"A man of parts, skilled in the subtlest sciences;
A patron of the arts, of poetry; and of a fine discernment.",modern
"Then comes a catalogue, his jewels of conversation.",modern
"No, you've not read your Elegantiae",modern
A dull book?shook the church.,modern
"The prefaces, cut clear and hard:",modern

"Spread for the nations, eucharist of wisdom,",modern
Bread of the liberal arts.,modern

Sordello would have your heart to give to all the princes;,modern
"Valla, the heart of Rome,",modern
"Sustaining speech, set out before the people.",modern
"Marius, Du Bellay, wept for the buildings,",modern
Baldassar Castiglione saw Raphael,modern
"Lead back the soul into its dead, waste dwelling,",modern
"Corpore laniato; and Lorenzo Valla,",modern
"Broken in middle life? bent to submission?
Took a fat living from the Papacy",modern
"(That's in Villari, but Burckhardt's statement is different)",modern
"More than the Roman city, the Roman speech",modern
(Holds fast its part among the ever-living).,modern
Not by the eagles only was Rome measured.,modern
"Wherever the Roman speech was, there was Rome,",modern
"Wherever the speech crept, there was mastery",modern
"Spoke with the law's voice while your Greek, logicians...",modern
"More Greeks than one! Doughty's ""divine Homeros""",modern

"Down to the ships we went, set mast and sail,
Black keel and beasts for bloody sacrifice,
Weeping we went.",modern
"I've strained my ear for -ensa, -ombra, and -ensa",modern
And cracked my wit on delicate canzoni,modern
Here's but rough meaning:,modern
"And then went down to the ship, set keel to breakers,",modern
Forth on the godly sea;,modern
"We set up mast and sail on the swarthy ship,",modern
"Sheep bore we aboard her, and our bodies also",modern
Heavy with weeping. And winds from sternward,modern
Bore us out onward with bellying canvas,modern
"Circe's this craft, the trim-coifed goddess.",modern
"Then sat we amidships, wind jamming the tiller.",modern
Thus with stretched sail,modern
We went over sea till day's end:,modern
"Sun to his slumber, shadows o'er all the ocean.",modern
"Came we then to the bounds of deepest water,",modern
To the Kimmerian lands and peopled cities,modern
"Covered with close-webbed mist, unpierced ever",modern
"With glitter of sun-rays,",modern
"Nor with stars stretched, nor looking back from heaven,",modern
Swartest night stretched over wretched men there.,modern
"Thither we in that ship, unladed sheep there,",modern
"The ocean flowing backward, came we through to the place",modern
Aforesaid by Circe.,modern
"Here did they rites, Perimedes and Eurylochus,",modern
And drawing sword from my hip,modern
"I dug the ell-square pitkin, poured we libations unto each the dead,",modern
"First mead and then sweet wine,",modern
Water mixed with white flour.,modern
Then prayed I many a prayer to the sickly death's-heads,modern
"As set in Ithaca, sterile bulls of the best,",modern
"For sacrifice, heaping the pyre with goods.",modern
"Sheep, to Tiresias only,",modern
"Black, and a bell sheep;",modern

"Of brides, of youths, and of many passing old,",modern
"Virgins tender, souls stained with recent tears,",modern
"Many men mauled with bronze lance-heads,",modern

"With shouting, pallor upon me, cried to my men for more beasts;",modern
"Slaughtered the herdssheep slain of bronze,",modern
"Poured ointment, cried to the gods,",modern
"To Pluto the strong, and praised Proserpine.",modern
"Unsheathed the narrow steel,",modern
"I sat to keep off the impetuous, impotent dead",modern
Till I should hear Tiresias.,modern
"But first Elpenor came, our friend Elpenor,",modern
"Unburied, cast on the wide earth",modern
"Limbs that we left in the house of Circe,",modern
"Unwept, unwrapped in sepulchre, since toils urged other,",modern
Pitiful spiritand I cried in hurried speech:,modern
"'Elpenor, how art thou come to this dark coast?",modern
"Cam'st thou afoot, outstripping seamen?' And he in heavy speech:",modern
"'Ill fate and abundant wine! I slept in Circe's ingle,",modern

A man of no fortune and with a name to come;,modern
"And set my oar up, that I swung 'mid fellows.'",modern
"Came then another ghost, whom I beat off, Anticlea,",modern

"Holding his golden wand, knew me and spoke first:",modern
"'Man of ill hour, why come a second time,",modern
"Leaving the sunlight, facing the sunless dead and this joyless region?",modern
"Stand from the fosse, move back, leave me my bloody bever,",modern
And I will speak you true speeches.',modern
"And I stepped back,",modern
Sheathing the yellow sword. Dark blood he drank then,modern
"And spoke: 'Lustrous Odysseus, shalt",modern
"Return through spiteful Neptune, over dark seas,",modern
Lose all companions.' Foretold me the ways and the signs.,modern
"Came then Anticlea, to whom I answered:",modern
'Fate drives me on through these deeps; I sought Tiresias.',modern
"I told her news of Troy, and thrice her shadow",modern
Faded in my embrace.,modern
Then had I news of many faded women,modern
"Tyro, Alcmena, Chloris",modern
"Heard out their tales by that dark fosse, and sailed",modern
"Light on the foam, breathed on by zephyrs,",modern
"And air-tending hours. Mirthful, orichalci, with golden",modern
Girdles and breast bands.,modern
"Thou with dark eye-lids,",modern
Bearing the golden bough of Argicida.,modern
"My love looks like a girl to-night,",modern
But she is old.,modern
The plaits that lie along her pillow,modern
"Are not gold,",modern
"But threaded with filigree silver,",modern
And uncanny cold.,modern
"She looks like a young maiden, since her brow",modern
"Is smooth and fair,",modern
"Her cheeks are very smooth, her eyes are closed.",modern
She sleeps a rare,modern
"Still winsome sleep, so still, and so composed.",modern
"Nay, but she sleeps like a bride, and dreams her dreams",modern
Of perfect things.,modern
"She lies at last, the darling, in the shape of her dream,",modern
And her dead mouth sings,modern
"By its shape, like the thrushes in clear evenings.I",modern
The mind has shown itself at times,modern
Too much the baked and labeled dough,modern
Divided by accepted multitudes.,modern
Across the stacked partitions of the day,modern
"Across the memoranda, baseball scores,",modern
The stenographic smiles and stock quotations,modern
Smutty wings flash out equivocations.,modern
The mind is brushed by sparrow wings;,modern
"Numbers, rebuffed by asphalt, crowd",modern
"The margins of the day, accent the curbs,",modern
Convoying divers dawns on every corner,modern
"To druggist, barber and tobacconist,",modern
Until the graduate opacities of evening,modern
Take them away as suddenly to somewhere,modern
"Virginal perhaps, less fragmentary, cool.",modern
There is the world dimensional for,modern
those untwisted by the love of things,modern
"And yet, suppose some evening I forgot",modern
"The fare and transfer, yet got by that way",modern
"Without recall,lost yet poised in traffic.",modern
"Then I might find your eyes across an aisle,",modern
Still flickering with those prefigurations,modern
"Prodigal, yet uncontested now,",modern
Half-riant before the jerky window frame.,modern
"There is some way, I think, to touch",modern
Those hands of yours that count the nights,modern
Stippled with pink and green advertisements.,modern
"And now, before its arteries turn dark",modern
I would have you meet this bartered blood.,modern
"Imminent in his dream, none better knows",modern
"The white wafer cheek of love, or offers words",modern
Lightly as moonlight on the eaves meets snow.,modern
Reflective conversion of all things,modern
"At your deep blush, when ecstasies thread",modern
"The limbs and belly, when rainbows spread",modern
Impinging on the throat and sides ...   ,modern
"Inevitable, the body of the world",modern
Weeps in inventive dust for the hiatus,modern
"That winks above it, bluet in your breasts.",modern
The earth may glide diaphanous to death;,modern
But if I lift my arms it is to bend,modern
"To you who turned away once, Helen, knowing",modern
"The press of troubled hands, too alternate",modern
With steel and soil to hold you endlessly.,modern
"I meet you, therefore, in that eventual flame",modern
"You found in final chains, no captive then",modern
"Beyond their million brittle, bloodshot eyes;",modern
"White, through white cities passed on to assume",modern
That world which comes to each of us alone.,modern
"Accept a lone eye riveted to your plane,",modern
Bent axle of devotion along companion ways,modern
"That beat, continuous, to hourless days",modern
"One inconspicuous, glowing orb of praise.",modern
Brazen hypnotics glitter here;,modern
"Glee shifts from foot to foot,",modern
Magnetic to their tremulo.,modern
"This crashing opera bouffe,",modern
Blest excursion! this ricochet,modern
From roof to roof,modern
"Know, Olympians, we are breathless",modern
While nigger cupids scour the stars!,modern
A thousand light shrugs balance us,modern
Through snarling hails of melody.,modern
White shadows slip across the floor,modern
Splayed like cards from a loose hand;,modern
Rhythmic ellipses lead into canters,modern
Until somewhere a rooster banters.,modern
Greet naivelyyet intrepidly,modern
"New soothings, new amazements",modern
That cornets introduce at every turn,modern
And you may fall downstairs with me,modern
With perfect grace and equanimity.,modern
"Or, plaintively scud past shores",modern
"Where, by strange harmonic laws",modern
"All relatives, serene and cool,",modern
Sit rocked in patent armchairs.,modern
"O,I have known metallic paradises",modern
Where cuckoos clucked to finches,modern
Above the deft catastrophes of drums.,modern
While titters hailed the groans of death,modern
Beneath gyrating awnings I have seen,modern
The incunabula of the divine grotesque.,modern
This music has a reassuring way.,modern
The siren of the springs of guilty song,modern
Let us take her on the incandescent wax,modern
"Striated with nuances, nervosities",modern
"That we are heir to: she is still so young,",modern
"We cannot frown upon her as she smiles,",modern
Dipping here in this cultivated storm,modern
Among slim skaters of the gardened skies.,modern
Capped arbiter of beauty in this street,modern
"That narrows darkly into motor dawn,",modern
"You, here beside me, delicate ambassador",modern
Of intricate slain numbers that arise,modern
"In whispers, naked of steel;",modern
religious gunman!,modern
"Who faithfully, yourself, will fall too soon,",modern
And in other ways than as the wind settles,modern
On the sixteen thrifty bridges of the city:,modern
Let us unbind our throats of fear and pity.,modern
"We even,",modern
Who drove speediest destruction,modern
"In corymbulous formations of mechanics,",modern
"Who hurried the hill breezes, spouting malice",modern
"Plangent over meadows, and looked down",modern
On rifts of torn and empty houses,modern
Like old women with teeth unjubilant,modern
"That waited faintly, briefly and in vain:",modern
"We know, eternal gunman, our flesh remembers",modern
"The tensile boughs, the nimble blue plateaus,",modern
"The mounted, yielding cities of the air!",modern
That saddled sky that shook down vertical,modern
Repeated play of fireno hypogeum,modern
Of wave or rock was good against one hour.,modern
"We did not ask for that, but have survived,",modern
And will persist to speak again before,modern
All stubble streets that have not curved,modern
"To memory, or known the ominous lifted arm",modern
That lowers down the arc of Helens brow,modern
To saturate with blessing and dismay.,modern
"A goose, tobacco and cologne",modern
"Three winged and gold-shod prophecies of heaven,",modern
The lavish heart shall always have to leaven,modern
"And spread with bells and voices, and atone",modern
The abating shadows of our conscript dust.,modern
"Anchises navel, dripping of the sea,",modern
"The hands Erasmus dipped in gleaming tides,",modern
Gathered the voltage of blown blood and vine;,modern
"Delve upward for the new and scattered wine,",modern
"O brother-thief of time, that we recall.",modern
Laugh out the meager penance of their days,modern
"Who dare not share with us the breath released,",modern
The substance drilled and spent beyond repair,modern
"For golden, or the shadow of gold hair.",modern
"Distinctly praise the years, whose volatile",modern
Blamed bleeding hands extend and thresh the height,modern
"The imagination spans beyond despair,",modern
"Outpacing bargain, vocable and prayer.",modern
We passed old farmer Boothby in the field.,modern
Rugged and straight he stood; his body steeled,modern
With stubbornness and age. We met his eyes,modern
"That never flinched or turned to compromise,",modern
"And Luck, he cried, good luck!and waved an arm,",modern
"Knotted and sailor-like, such as no farm",modern
In all of Maine could boast of; and away,modern
He turned again to pitch his new-cut hay...,modern
We walked on leisurely until a bend,modern
"Showed him once more, now working toward the end",modern
Of one great path; wearing his eighty years,modern
Like banners lifted in a wind of cheers.,modern
Then we turned off abruptlytook the road,modern
"Cutting the village, the one with the commanding",modern
View of the river. And we strode,modern
More briskly now to the long pier that showed,modern
Where the frail boats were kept at Indian Landing.,modern
In the canoe we stepped; our paddles dipped,modern
"Leisurely downwards, and the slim bark slipped",modern
More on than in the water. Smoothly then,modern
"We shot its nose against the rippling current,",modern
Feeling the rising rivers half-deterrent,modern
Pull on the paddle as we turned the blade,modern
To keep from swerving round; while we delayed,modern
To watch the curious wave-eaten locks;,modern
"Or pass, with lazy turns, the picnic-rocks....",modern
"Blue eels flew under us, and fishes darted",modern
A thousand ways; the once broad channel shrunk.,modern
And over us the wise and noble-hearted,modern
"Twilight leaned down; the sunset mists were parted,",modern
"And we, with thoughts on tiptoe, slunk",modern
"Down the green, twisting alleys of the Kennebunk,",modern
Motionless in the meadows,modern
"The trees, the rocks, the cows...",modern
And quiet dripped from the shadows,modern
Like rain from heavy boughs.,modern
The tree-toads started ringing,modern
Their ceaseless silver bells;,modern
A land-locked breeze came swinging,modern
Its censer of earthy smells.,modern
The rivers tiny canon,modern
Stretched into dusky lands;,modern
Like a dark and silent companion,modern
Evening held out her hands.,modern
Hushed were the dawns bravados;,modern
Loud noon was a silenced cry,modern
And quiet slipped from the shadows,modern
As stars slip out of the sky...,modern
"It must have been an hour more, or later,",modern
"When, tramping homeward through the piney wood,",modern
We felt the years fly back; the brotherhood,modern
Of forests took usand we saw the satyr!,modern
"There in a pool, up to his neck, he stood",modern
"And grinned to see us stare, incredulous",modern
Too startled to remember fear or flight.,modern
"Feeling the menace in the crafty night,",modern
"We turned to runwhen lo, he called to us!",modern
Using our very names he called. We drew,modern
With creaking courage down the avenue,modern
"Of birches till we saw, with clearing sight,",modern
"(No longer through a tricky, pale-green light)",modern
"Familiar turns and shrubs, the friendly path,",modern
And Farmer Boothby in his woodland bath!,modern
The woods became his background; every tree,modern
"Seemed part of him, and stood erect, and shared",modern
The beauty of that gnarled serenity;,modern
The quiet vigor of age that smiled and squared,modern
Its shoulders against Time ... And even night,modern
"Flowed in and out of him, as though content",modern
With such a native element;,modern
Happy to move about a spirit quite,modern
"As old, as placid and as confident...",modern
Sideways we turned. Still glistening and unclad,modern
"He leaped up on the bank, light as a lad,",modern
His body in the moonlight dripping stars...,modern
"We went on homeward, through the pasture-bars.",modern
"Living, I had no might",modern
"To make you hear,",modern
"Now, in the inmost night,",modern
I am so near,modern
"No whisper, falling light,",modern
"Divides us, dear.",modern
"Living, I had no claim",modern
On your great hours.,modern
"Now the thin candle-flame,",modern
"The closing flowers,",modern
"Wed summer with my name, ",modern
And these are ours.,modern
"Your shadow on the dust,",modern
"Strength, and a cry,",modern
"Delight, despair, mistrust, ",modern
All these am I.,modern
"Dawn, and the far hills thrust",modern
To a far sky.,modern
"Living, I had no skill",modern
"To stay your tread,",modern
Now all that was my will,modern
Silence has said.,modern
We are one for good and ill,modern
"Since I am dead.Momus is the name men give your face,",modern
"The brag of its tone, like a long low steamboat whistle",modern
"Finding a way mid mist on a shoreland,",modern
"Where gray rocks let the salt water shatter spray Against horizons purple, silent.",modern
"Yes, Momus,",modern
Men have flung your face in bronze,modern
To gaze in gargoyle downward on a street-whirl of folk.,modern
"They were artists did this, shaped your sad mouth,",modern
"Gave you a tall forehead slanted with calm, broad wisdom;",modern
All your lips to the corners and your cheeks to the high bones,modern
"Thrown over and through with a smile that forever wishes and wishes, purple, silent, fled from all the iron things of life, evaded like a sought bandit, gone into dreams, by God.",modern
"I wonder, Momus,",modern
Whether shadows of the dead sit somewhere and look with deep laughter,modern
"On men who play in terrible earnest the old, known, solemn repetitions of history.",modern
"A droning monotone soft as sea laughter hovers from your kindliness of bronze,",modern
"You give me the human ease of a mountain peak, purple, silent;",modern
"Granite shoulders heaving above the earth curves,",modern
Careless eye-witness of the spawning tides of men and women,modern
"Swarming always in a drift of millions to the dust of toil, the salt of tears,",modern
"And blood drops of undiminishing war.Potuia, potuia",modern
"White grave goddess,",modern
"Pity my sadness,",modern
O silence of Paros.,modern
"I am not of these about thy feet,",modern
These garments and decorum;,modern
"I am thy brother,",modern
"Thy lover of aforetime crying to thee,",modern
And thou hearest me not.,modern
I have whispered thee in thy solitudes,modern
"Of our loves in Phrygia,",modern
The far ecstasy of burning noons,modern
When the fragile pipes,modern
"Ceased in the cypress shade,",modern
And the brown fingers of the shepherd,modern
Moved over slim shoulders;,modern
And only the cicada sang.,modern
I have told thee of the hills,modern
And the lisp of reeds,modern
"And the sun upon thy breasts,",modern
"And thou hearest me not,",modern
"Potuia, potuia",modern
Thou hearest me not.The ancient songs,modern
Pass deathward mournfully.,modern
"Cold lips that sing no more, and withered wreaths,",modern
"Regretful eyes, and drooping breasts and wings",modern
Symbols of ancient songs,modern
Mournfully passing,modern
"Down to the great white surges,",modern
Watched of none         - -,modern
Save the frail sea-birds,modern
"And the lithe pale girls,",modern
Daughters of Okeanos.,modern
And the songs pass,modern
From the green land,modern
Which lies upon the waves as a leaf,modern
On the flowers of hyacinth;,modern
"And they pass from the waters,",modern
"The manifold winds and the dim moon,",modern
"And they come,",modern
"Silently winging through soft Kimmerian dusk,",modern
To the quiet level lands,modern
"That she keeps for us all,",modern
That she wrought for us all for sleep,modern
In the silver days of the earth's dawning,modern
"Proserpine, daughter of Zeus.",modern
"And we turn from the Kuprian's breasts,",modern
"And we turn from thee,",modern
"Phoibos Apollon,",modern
And we turn from the music of old,modern
"And the hills that we loved and the meads,",modern
"And we turn from the fiery day,",modern
And the lips that were over-sweet;,modern
For silently,modern
"Brushing the fields with red-shod feet,",modern
With purple robe,modern
"Searing the flowers as with a sudden flame,",modern
"Death,",modern
Thou hast come upon us.,modern
And of all the ancient songs,modern
Passing to the swallow-blue halls,modern
"By the dark streams of Persephone,",modern
This only remains:,modern
"That in the end we turn to thee,",modern
"Death,",modern
"That we turn to thee, singing",modern
One last song.,modern
"O Death,",modern
Thou art an healing wind,modern
That blowest over white flowers,modern
A-tremble with dew;,modern
Thou art a wind flowing,modern
Over long leagues of lonely sea;,modern
Thou art the dusk and the fragrance;,modern
Thou art the lips of love mournfully smiling;,modern
Thou art the pale peace of one,modern
Satiate with old desires;,modern
"Thou art the silence of beauty,",modern
And we look no more for the morning;,modern
"We yearn no more for the sun,",modern
"Since with thy white hands,",modern
"Death,",modern
"Thou crownest us with the pallid chaplets,",modern
The slim colorless poppies,modern
Which in thy garden alone,modern
Softly thou gatherest.,modern
And silently;,modern
And with slow feet approaching;,modern
"And with bowed head and unlit eyes,",modern
We kneel before thee:,modern
"And thou, leaning towards us, Caressingly layest upon us",modern
"Flowers from thy thin cold hands,",modern
"And, smiling as a chaste woman Knowing love in her heart,",modern
Thou sealest our eyes,modern
And the illimitable quietude,modern
Comes gently upon us.,modern
Knock knock He has closed his door,modern
The gardens lilies have started to rot,modern
So who is the corpse being carried from the house,modern
You just knocked on his door,modern
And trot trot,modern
Trot goes little lady mouse,modern
Translated from the French I have built a house in the middle of the Ocean,modern
Its windows are the rivers flowing from my eyes,modern
Octopi are crawling all over where the walls are,modern
Hear their triple hearts beat and their beaks peck against the windowpanes,modern
House of dampness,modern
House of burning,modern
Seasons fastness,modern
Season singing,modern
The airplanes are laying eggs,modern
Watch out for the dropping of the anchor,modern
Watch out for the shooting black ichor,modern
It would be good if you were to come from the sky,modern
The skys honeysuckle is climbing,modern
The earthly octopi are throbbing,modern
And so very many of us have become our own gravediggers,modern
Pale octopi of the chalky waves O octopi with pale beaks,modern
Around the house is this ocean that you know well,modern
  And is never still,modern
"Translated from the French Wallace Stevens,",modern
"O sweet everlasting Voices, be still;",modern
Go to the guards of the heavenly fold,modern
"And bid them wander obeying your will,",modern
"Flame under flame, till Time be no more;",modern
"Have you not heard that our hearts are old,",modern
"That you call in birds, in wind on the hill,",modern
"In shaken boughs, in tide on the shore?",modern
"O sweet everlasting Voices, be still. Although you hide in the ebb and flow",modern
"Of the pale tide when the moon has set,",modern
The people of coming days will know,modern
"About the casting out of my net,",modern
And how you have leaped times out of mind,modern
"Over the little silver cords,",modern
"And think that you were hard and unkind,",modern
"And blame you with many bitter words.She that but little patience knew,",modern
"From childhood on, had now so much",modern
A grey gull lost its fear and flew,modern
"Down to her cell and there alit,",modern
And there endured her fingers' touch,modern
And from her fingers ate its bit.,modern
Did she in touching that lone wing,modern
Recall the years before her mind,modern
"Became a bitter, an abstract thing,",modern
Her thought some popular enmity:,modern
Blind and leader of the blind,modern
Drinking the foul ditch where they lie?,modern
When long ago I saw her ride,modern
"Under Ben Bulben to the meet,",modern
The beauty of her country-side,modern
"With all youth's lonely wildness stirred,",modern
She seemed to have grown clean and sweet,modern
"Like any rock-bred, sea-borne bird:",modern
"Sea-borne, or balanced in the air",modern
When first it sprang out of the nest,modern
Upon some lofty rock to stare,modern
"Upon the cloudy canopy,",modern
While under its storm-beaten breast,modern
"Cried out the hollows of the sea.There was a man whom Sorrow named his friend,",modern
"And he, of his high comrade Sorrow dreaming,",modern
Went walking with slow steps along the gleaming,modern
"And humming sands, where windy surges wend:",modern
And he called loudly to the stars to bend,modern
"From their pale thrones and comfort him, but they",modern
Among themselves laugh on and sing alway:,modern
And then the man whom Sorrow named his friend,modern
"Cried out, Dim sea, hear my most piteous story!",modern
"The sea swept on and cried her old cry still,",modern
Rolling along in dreams from hill to hill.,modern
He fled the persecution of her glory,modern
"And, in a far-off, gentle valley stopping,",modern
Cried all his story to the dewdrops glistening.,modern
"But naught they heard, for they are always listening,",modern
"The dewdrops, for the sound of their own dropping.",modern
And then the man whom Sorrow named his friend,modern
"Sought once again the shore, and found a shell,",modern
"And thought, I will my heavy story tell",modern
"Till my own words, re-echoing, shall send",modern
"Their sadness through a hollow, pearly heart;",modern
"And my own tale again for me shall sing,",modern
"And my own whispering words be comforting,",modern
And lo! my ancient burden may depart.,modern
Then he sang softly nigh the pearly rim;,modern
But the sad dweller by the sea-ways lone,modern
Changed all he sang to inarticulate moan,modern
"Among her wildering whirls, forgetting him. The woods of Arcady are dead,",modern
And over is their antique joy;,modern
Of old the world on dreaming fed;,modern
Grey Truth is now her painted toy;,modern
Yet still she turns her restless head:,modern
"But O, sick children of the world,",modern
Of all the many changing things,modern
"In dreary dancing past us whirled,",modern
"To the cracked tune that Chronos sings,",modern
Words alone are certain good.,modern
"Where are now the warring kings,",modern
Word be-mockers?  By the Rood,modern
Where are now the warring kings?,modern
"An idle word is now their glory,",modern
"By the stammering schoolboy said,",modern
Reading some entangled story:,modern
The kings of the old time are dead;,modern
The wandering earth herself may be,modern
"Only a sudden flaming word,",modern
"In clanging space a moment heard,",modern
Troubling the endless reverie.,modern
"Then nowise worship dusty deeds,",modern
"Nor seek, for this is also sooth,",modern
"To hunger fiercely after truth,",modern
Lest all thy toiling only breeds,modern
"New dreams, new dreams; there is no truth",modern
"Saving in thine own heart. Seek, then,",modern
"No learning from the starry men,",modern
Who follow with the optic glass,modern
The whirling ways of stars that pass  ,modern
"Seek, then, for this is also sooth,",modern
No word of theirs  the cold star-bane,modern
"Has cloven and rent their hearts in twain,",modern
And dead is all their human truth.,modern
Go gather by the humming sea,modern
"Some twisted, echo-harbouring shell,",modern
"And to its lips thy story tell,",modern
"And they thy comforters will be,",modern
Rewarding in melodious guile,modern
"Thy fretful words a little while,",modern
Till they shall singing fade in ruth,modern
And die a pearly brotherhood;,modern
For words alone are certain good:,modern
"Sing, then, for this is also sooth.",modern
I must be gone: there is a grave,modern
"Where daffodil and lily wave,",modern
"And I would please the hapless faun,",modern
"Buried under the sleepy ground,",modern
With mirthful songs before the dawn.,modern
His shouting days with mirth were crowned;,modern
"And still I dream he treads the lawn,",modern
"Walking ghostly in the dew,",modern
"Pierced by my glad singing through,",modern
My songs of old earth's dreamy youth:,modern
But ah! she dreams not now; dream thou!,modern
For fair are poppies on the brow:,modern
"Dream, dream, for this is also sooth.",modern
Only the wanderer,modern
"Knows England's graces,",modern
Or can anew see clear,modern
Familiar faces.,modern
And who loves joy as he,modern
That dwells in shadows?,modern
"Do not forget me quite,",modern
"O Severn meadows.He's gone, and all our plans",modern
Are useless indeed.,modern
We'll walk no more on Cotswold,modern
Where the sheep feed,modern
Quietly and take no heed.,modern
His body that was so quick,modern
Is not as you,modern
"Knew it, on Severn river",modern
Under the blue,modern
Driving our small boat through.,modern
You would not know him now ...,modern
But still he died,modern
"Nobly, so cover him over",modern
With violets of pride,modern
Purple from Severn side.,modern
"Cover him, cover him soon!",modern
And with thick-set,modern
Masses of memoried flowers,modern
Hide that red wet,modern
Thing I must somehow forget.By a peninsula the painter sat and,modern
Sketched the uneven valley groves.,modern
The apostle gave alms to the,modern
Meek. The volcano burst,modern
In fusive sulphur and hurled,modern
Rocks and ore into the air,modern
Heavens sudden change at,modern
"The drawing tempestuous,",modern
Darkening shade of dense clouded hues.,modern
The wanderer soon chose,modern
His spot of rest; they bore the,modern
"Chosen hero upon their shoulders,",modern
"Whom they strangely admired, as",modern
The beach-tide summer of people desired.Is this the river East I heard?,modern
"Where the ferries, tugs and sailboats stirred",modern
And the reaching wharves from the inner land,modern
"Ourstretched, like the harmless receiving hand",modern
And the silvery tinge that sparkles aloud,modern
"Like the brilliant white demons, which a tide has towed",modern
From the rays of the morning sun,modern
Which it doth ceaselessly shine upon.,modern
But look at the depth of the drippling tide,modern
"The dripples, reripples like the locusts astride;",modern
As the boat turns upon the silvery spread,modern
It leavesstrangea shadow dead.,modern
And the very charms from the reflective river,modern
And from the stacks of the floating boat,modern
There seemeth the quality neer to dissever,modern
Like the ruffles from the mystified smoke. The motion of gathering loops of water,modern
Must either burst or remain in a moment.,modern
The violet colors through the glass,modern
Throw up little swellings that appear,modern
And spatter as soon as another strikes,modern
And is born; so pure are they of colored,modern
"Hues, that we feel the absent strength",modern
Of its power. When they begin they gather,modern
Like sand on the beach: each bubble,modern
"Contains a complete eye of water.I went out to the hazel wood,",modern
"Because a fire was in my head,",modern
"And cut and peeled a hazel wand,",modern
And hooked a berry to a thread;,modern
"And when white moths were on the wing,",modern
"And moth-like stars were flickering out,",modern
I dropped the berry in a stream,modern
And caught a little silver trout.,modern
When I had laid it on the floor,modern
"I went to blow the fire a-flame,",modern
"But something rustled on the floor,",modern
And someone called me by my name:,modern
It had become a glimmering girl,modern
With apple blossom in her hair,modern
Who called me by my name and ran,modern
And faded through the brightening air.,modern
Though I am old with wandering,modern
"Through hollow lands and hilly lands,",modern
"I will find out where she has gone,",modern
And kiss her lips and take her hands;,modern
"And walk among long dappled grass,",modern
"And pluck till time and times are done,",modern
"The silver apples of the moon,",modern
The golden apples of the sun.,modern
Barque of phosphor,modern
"On the palmy beach,",modern
"Move outward into heaven,",modern
Into the alabasters,modern
And night blues.,modern
Foam and cloud are one.,modern
Sultry moon-monsters,modern
Are dissolving.,modern
Fill your black hull,modern
With white moonlight.,modern
There will never be an end,modern
To this droning of the surf.The trade-wind jingles the rings in the nets around the racks by the docks on Indian River.,modern
"It is the same jingle of the water among roots under the banks of the palmettoes,",modern
It is the same jingle of the red-bird breasting the orange-treesout of the cedars.,modern
"Yet there is no spring in Florida, neither in boskage perdu, nor on the nunnery beaches. Her terrace was the sand",modern
And the palms and the twilight.,modern
She made of the motions of her wrist,modern
The grandiose gestures,modern
Of her thought.,modern
The rumpling of the plumes,modern
Of this creature of the evening,modern
Came to be sleights of sails,modern
Over the sea.,modern
And thus she roamed,modern
"In the roamings of her fan,",modern
"Partaking of the sea,",modern
"And of the evening,",modern
As they flowed around,modern
And uttered their subsiding sound.As the immense dew of Florida,modern
Brings forth,modern
The big-finned palm,modern
"And green vine angering for life,",modern
As the immense dew of Florida,modern
Brings forth hymn and hymn,modern
"From the beholder,",modern
Beholding all these green sides,modern
"And gold sides of green sides,",modern
"And blessed mornings,",modern
"Meet for the eye of the young alligator,",modern
And lightning colors,modern
"So, in me, come flinging",modern
"Forms, flames, and the flakes of flames.",modern
"The moon has left the sky, love,",modern
"The stars are hiding now,",modern
"And frowning on the world, love,",modern
Night bares her sable brow.,modern
"The snow is on the ground, love,",modern
And cold and keen the air is.,modern
"Im singing here to you, love;",modern
Youre dreaming there in Paris.,modern
"But this is Natures law, love,",modern
"Though just it may not seem,",modern
"That men should wake to sing, love;",modern
While maidens sleep and dream.,modern
"Them care may not molest, love,",modern
"Nor stir them from their slumbers,",modern
"Though midnight find the swain, love.",modern
Still halting oer his numbers.,modern
"I watch the rosy dawn, love,",modern
"Come stealing up the east,",modern
"While all things round rejoice, love,",modern
That Night her reign has ceased.,modern
"The lark will soon be heard, love,",modern
And on his way be winging;,modern
"When Natures poets, wake, love,",modern
Why should a man be singing?The buffaloes are gone.,modern
And those who saw the buffaloes are gone.,modern
"Those who saw the buffaloes by thousands and how they pawed the prairie sod into dust with their hoofs, their great heads down pawing on in a great pageant of dusk,",modern
Those who saw the buffaloes are gone.,modern
And the buffaloes are gone.There is a wolf in me . . . fangs pointed for tearing gashes . . . a red tongue for raw meat . . . and the hot lapping of bloodI keep this wolf because the wilderness gave it to me and the wilderness will not let it go.    ,modern

Finally to answer all within one grave!,modern

Furrow of all our traveltrailed derision!,modern
Eyes crumble at its kiss. Its long-drawn spell,modern
Incites a yell. Slid on that backward vision,modern
"The mind is churned to spittle, whispering hell.",modern
I wanted you . . . The embers of the Cross,modern
Climbed by aslant and huddling aromatically.,modern
It is blood to remember; it is fire,modern
To stammer back . . . It is,modern
Godyour namelessness. And the wash,modern
All night the water combed you with black,modern
"Insolence. You crept out simmering, accomplished.",modern

"Rehearsed hairdocile, alas, from many arms.",modern
"Yes, Evewraith of my unloved seed!",modern

Light drowned the lithic trillions of your spawn.,modern

"The salt, salt smell of the thick sea air,",modern
"And the smooth round stones that the ebbtides wear,",modern
When will the good ship come?,modern
"The wretched stumps all charred and burned,",modern
"And the deep soft rut where the cartwheel turned,",modern
Why is the world so old?,modern
"The lapping wave, and the broad gray sky",modern
"Where the cawing crows and the slow gulls fly,",modern
Where are the dead untold?,modern

Sorrow with life began!,modern

What will become of man?Guillaume Apollinaire.,modern
While my hair was still cut straight across my forehead,modern
"I played about the front gate, pulling flowers.",modern
"You came by on bamboo stilts, playing horse,",modern
"You walked about my seat, playing with blue plums.",modern
And we went on living in the village of Chokan:,modern
"Two small people, without dislike or suspicion.",modern
At fourteen I married My Lord you.,modern
"I never laughed, being bashful.",modern
"Lowering my head, I looked at the wall.",modern
"Called to, a thousand times, I never looked back.",modern
"At fifteen I stopped scowling,",modern
I desired my dust to be mingled with yours,modern

Why should I climb the look out?,modern
At sixteen you departed,modern

And you have been gone five months.,modern
The monkeys make sorrowful noise overhead.,modern
You dragged your feet when you went out.,modern

And hours alone too still and sure for prayer,modern
"Since darkness waits for me, then all the more",modern
Let me go down as waves sweep to the shore,modern

In these few hours of light I lift my head;,modern
Life is my loverI shall leave the dead,modern
If there is any way to baffle death.,modern
"I know what the caged bird feels, alas!",modern
When the sun is bright on the upland slopes;   ,modern
"When the wind stirs soft through the springing grass,   ",modern
And the river flows like a stream of glass;,modern
"When the first bird sings and the first bud opes,   ",modern
And the faint perfume from its chalice steals,modern
I know what the caged bird feels!,modern
I know why the caged bird beats his wing,modern
Till its blood is red on the cruel bars;   ,modern
For he must fly back to his perch and cling   ,modern
When he fain would be on the bough a-swing;,modern
"And a pain still throbs in the old, old scars   ",modern
And they pulse again with a keener sting,modern
I know why he beats his wing!,modern
"I know why the caged bird sings, ah me,",modern
"When his wing is bruised and his bosom sore,",modern
When he beats his bars and he would be free;,modern
"It is not a carol of joy or glee,",modern
"But a prayer that he sends from his hearts deep core,   ",modern
"But a plea, that upward to Heaven he flings",modern
I know why the caged bird sings!,modern
"There may be chaos still around the world,",modern
This little world that in my thinking lies;,modern
For mine own bosom is the paradise,modern
Where all my lifes fair visions are unfurled.,modern
"Within my natures shell I slumber curled,",modern
"Unmindful of the changing outer skies,",modern
"Where now, perchance, some new-born Eros flies,",modern
Or some old Cronos from his throne is hurled.,modern
I heed them not; or if the subtle night,modern
"Haunt me with deities I never saw,",modern
I soon mine eyelids drowsy curtain draw,modern
To hide their myriad faces from my sight.,modern
They threat in vain; the whirlwind cannot awe,modern
A happy snow-flake dancing in the flaw.I,modern
"Among twenty snowy mountains,",modern
The only moving thing,modern
Was the eye of the blackbird.,modern
"I was of three minds,",modern
Like a tree,modern
In which there are three blackbirds.,modern
The blackbird whirled in the autumn winds.,modern
It was a small part of the pantomime.,modern
A man and a woman,modern
Are one.,modern
A man and a woman and a blackbird   ,modern
Are one.,modern
"I do not know which to prefer,",modern
The beauty of inflections,modern
"Or the beauty of innuendoes,",modern
The blackbird whistling,modern
Or just after.,modern
Icicles filled the long window,modern
With barbaric glass.,modern
The shadow of the blackbird,modern
"Crossed it, to and fro.",modern
The mood,modern
Traced in the shadow,modern
An indecipherable cause.,modern
"O thin men of Haddam,",modern
Why do you imagine golden birds?,modern
Do you not see how the blackbird,modern
Walks around the feet,modern
Of the women about you?,modern
I know noble accents,modern
"And lucid, inescapable rhythms;",modern
"But I know, too,",modern
That the blackbird is involved,modern
In what I know.,modern
"When the blackbird flew out of sight,",modern
It marked the edge,modern
Of one of many circles.,modern
At the sight of blackbirds,modern
"Flying in a green light,",modern
Even the bawds of euphony,modern
Would cry out sharply.,modern
He rode over Connecticut,modern
In a glass coach.,modern
"Once, a fear pierced him,",modern
In that he mistook,modern
The shadow of his equipage,modern
For blackbirds.,modern
The river is moving.,modern
The blackbird must be flying.,modern
It was evening all afternoon.,modern
It was snowing,modern
And it was going to snow.,modern
The blackbird sat,modern
In the cedar-limbs.I,modern
"Calm was the sea to which your course you kept,",modern
"Oh, how much calmer than all southern seas!",modern
"Many your nameless mates, whom the keen breeze",modern
Wafted from mothers that of old have wept.,modern
All souls of children taken as they slept,modern
"Are your companions, partners of your ease,",modern
And the green souls of all these autumn trees,modern
Are with you through the silent spaces swept.,modern
Your virgin body gave its gentle breath,modern
"Untainted to the gods. Why should we grieve,",modern
But that we merit not your holy death?,modern
"We shall not loiter long, your friends and I;",modern
"Living you made it goodlier to live,",modern
Dead you will make it easier to die.,modern
With you a part of me hath passed away;,modern
For in the peopled forest of my mind,modern
A tree made leafless by this wintry wind,modern
Shall never don again its green array.,modern
"Chapel and fireside, country road and bay,",modern
Have something of their friendliness resigned;,modern
"Another, if I would, I could not find,",modern
And I am grown much older in a day.,modern
But yet I treasure in my memory,modern
"Your gift of charity, your mellow ease,",modern
And the dear honour of your amity;,modern
"For these once mine, my life is rich with these.",modern
"And I scarce know which part may greater be,",modern
"What I keep of you, or you rob of me.",modern
Your bark lies anchored in the peaceful bight,modern
Until a kinder wind unfurl her sail;,modern
"Your docile spirit, winged by this gale,",modern
Hath at the dawning fled into the light.,modern
And I half know why heaven deemed it right,modern
"Your youth, and this my joy in youth, should fail;",modern
"God hath them still, for ever they avail,",modern
Eternity hath borrowed that delight.,modern
For long ago I taught my thoughts to run,modern
"Where all the great things live that lived of yore,",modern
And in eternal quiet float and soar;,modern
"There all my loves are gathered into one,",modern
"Where change is not, nor parting any more,",modern
Nor revolution of the moon and sun.,modern
In my deep heart these chimes would still have rung,modern
"To toll your passing, had you not been dead;",modern
For time a sadder mask than death may spread,modern
Over the face that ever should be young.,modern
The bough that falls with all its trophies hung,modern
"Falls not too soon, but lays its flower-crowned head",modern
"Most royal in the dust, with no leaf shed",modern
Unhallowed or unchiselled or unsung.,modern
And though the after world will never hear,modern
"The happy name of one so gently true,",modern
"Nor chronicles write large this fatal year,",modern
"Yet we who loved you, though we be but few,",modern
"Keep you in whatsoeer is good, and rear",modern
In our weak virtues monuments to you.,modern
But then there comes that moment rare,modern
"When, for no cause that I can find,",modern
The little voices of the air,modern
Sound above all the sea and wind.,modern
The sea and wind do then obey,modern
"And sighing, sighing double notes",modern
"Of double basses, content to play",modern
A droning chord for the little throats,modern
The little throats that sing and rise,modern
Up into the light with lovely ease,modern
"And a kind of magical, sweet surprise",modern
To hear and know themselves for these,modern
"For these little voices: the bee, the fly,",modern
"The leaf that taps, the pod that breaks,",modern
"The breeze on the grass-tops bending by,",modern
The shrill quick sound that the insect makes,modern
"Even iron can put forth,",modern
Even iron.,modern
"This is the iron age,",modern
But let us take heart,modern
"Seeing iron break and bud,",modern
Seeing rusty iron puff with clouds of blossom.,modern
"The almond-tree,",modern
December's bare iron hooks sticking out of earth.,modern
"The almond-tree,",modern
"That knows the deadliest poison, like a snake",modern
In supreme bitterness.,modern
"Upon the iron, and upon the steel,",modern
"Odd flakes as if of snow, odd bits of snow,",modern
Odd crumbs of melting snow.,modern
"But you mistake, it is not from the sky;",modern
"From out the iron, and from out the steel,",modern
"Flying not down from heaven, but storming up,",modern
Strange storming up from the dense under-earth,modern
"Along the iron, to the living steel",modern
"In rose-hot tips, and flakes of rose-pale snow",modern
Setting supreme annunciation to the world.,modern
"Nay, what a heart of delicate super-faith,",modern
"Iron-breaking,",modern
The rusty swords of almond-trees.,modern
"Trees suffer, like races, down the long ages.",modern
"They wander and are exiled, they live in exile through long ages",modern
"Like drawn blades never sheathed, hacked and gone black,",modern
The alien trees in alien lands: and yet,modern
"The heart of blossom,",modern
The unquenchable heart of blossom!,modern
"Look at the many-cicatrised frail vine, none more scarred and frail,",modern
Yet see him fling himself abroad in fresh abandon,modern
From the small wound-stump.,modern
"Even the wilful, obstinate, gummy fig-tree",modern
"Can be kept down, but he'll burst like a polyp into prolixity.",modern
"And the almond-tree, in exile, in the iron age!",modern
"This is the ancient southern earth whence the vases were baked, amphoras, craters, cantharus, oenochoe, and open-hearted cylix,",modern
Bristling now with the iron of almond-trees,modern
"Iron, but unforgotten,",modern
"Iron, dawn-hearted,",modern
"Ever-beating dawn-heart, enveloped in iron against the exile, against the ages.",modern
See it come forth in blossom,modern
From the snow-remembering heart,modern
"In long-nighted January,",modern
"In the long dark nights of the evening star, and Sirius, and the Etna snow-wind through the long night.",modern
Sweating his drops of blood through the long-nighted Gethsemane,modern
"Into blossom, into pride, into honey-triumph, into most exquisite splendour.",modern
"Oh, give me the tree of life in blossom",modern
And the Cross sprouting its superb and fearless flowers!,modern
"Something must be reassuring to the almond, in the evening star, and the snow-wind, and the long, long, nights,",modern
"Some memory of far, sun-gentler lands,",modern
So that the faith in his heart smiles again,modern
"And his blood ripples with that untenable delight of once-more-vindicated faith,",modern
"And the Gethsemane blood at the iron pores unfolds, unfolds,",modern
Pearls itself into tenderness of bud,modern
"And in a great and sacred forthcoming steps forth, steps out in one stride",modern
"A naked tree of blossom, like a bridegroom bathing in dew, divested of cover,",modern
"Frail-naked, utterly uncovered",modern
"To the green night-baying of the dog-star, Etna's snow-edged wind",modern
And January's loud-seeming sun.,modern
"Think of it, from the iron fastness",modern
"Suddenly to dare to come out naked, in perfection of blossom, beyond the sword-rust.",modern
"Think, to stand there in full-unfolded nudity, smiling,",modern
"With all the snow-wind, and the sun-glare, and the dog-star baying epithalamion.",modern
"Oh, honey-bodied beautiful one,",modern
"Come forth from iron,",modern
Red your heart is.,modern
"Fragile-tender, fragile-tender life-body,",modern
"More fearless than iron all the time,",modern
"And so much prouder, so disdainful of reluctances.",modern
"In the distance like hoar-frost, like silvery ghosts communing on a green hill,",modern
Hoar-frost-like and mysterious.,modern
In the garden raying out,modern
"With a body like spray, dawn-tender, and looking about",modern
"With such insuperable, subtly-smiling assurance,",modern
Sword-blade-born.,modern
"Unpromised,",modern
No bounds being set.,modern
"Flaked out and come unpromised,",modern
"The tree being life-divine,",modern
"Fearing nothing, life-blissful at the core",modern
Within iron and earth.,modern
"Knots of pink, fish-silvery",modern
"In heaven, in blue, blue heaven,",modern
"Soundless, bliss-full, wide-rayed, honey-bodied,",modern
"Red at the core,",modern
"Red at the core,",modern
Knotted in heaven upon the fine light.,modern
"Open,",modern
"Open,",modern
"Five times wide open,",modern
"Six times wide open,",modern
"And given, and perfect;",modern
"And red at the core with the last sore-heartedness,",modern
Sore-hearted-looking.,modern
"At evening, sitting on this terrace,",modern
"When the sun from the west, beyond Pisa, beyond the mountains of Carrara",modern
"Departs, and the world is taken by surprise ...",modern
When the tired flower of Florence is in gloom beneath the glowing,modern
Brown hills surrounding ...,modern
When under the arches of the Ponte Vecchio,modern
"A green light enters against stream, flush from the west,",modern
Against the current of obscure Arno ...,modern
"Look up, and you see things flying",modern
Between the day and the night;,modern
Swallows with spools of dark thread sewing the shadows together.,modern
"A circle swoop, and a quick parabola under the bridge arches",modern
Where light pushes through;,modern
A sudden turning upon itself of a thing in the air.,modern
A dip to the water.,modern
And you think:,modern
The swallows are flying so late!,modern
Swallows?,modern
Dark air-life looping,modern
Yet missing the pure loop ...,modern
"A twitch, a twitter, an elastic shudder in flight",modern
"And serrated wings against the sky,",modern
"Like a glove, a black glove thrown up at the light,",modern
And falling back.,modern
Never swallows!,modern
Bats!,modern
The swallows are gone.,modern
At a wavering instant the swallows gave way to bats,modern
By the Ponte Vecchio ...,modern
Changing guard.,modern
"Bats, and an uneasy creeping in one's scalp",modern
As the bats swoop overhead!,modern
Flying madly.,modern
Pipistrello!,modern
Black piper on an infinitesimal pipe.,modern
"Little lumps that fly in air and have voices indefinite, wildly vindictive;",modern
Wings like bits of umbrella.,modern
Bats!,modern
"Creatures that hang themselves up like an old rag, to sleep;",modern
And disgustingly upside down.,modern
Hanging upside down like rows of disgusting old rags,modern
And grinning in their sleep.,modern
Bats!,modern
In China the bat is symbol for happiness.,modern
Not for me!Notes:,modern
"Then you shall see her truly--your blood remembering its first invasion of her secrecy, its first encounters with her kind, her chieftain lover...his shade that haunts the lakes and hills",modern
The bronze General Grant riding a bronze horse in Lincoln Park,modern
Shrivels in the sun by day when the motor cars whirr by in long processions going somewhere to keep apppointment for dinner and matinees and buying and selling,modern
Though in the dusk and nightfall when high waves are piling,modern
On the slabs of the promenade along the lake shore near by,modern
I have seen the general dare the combers come closer,modern
And make to ride his bronze horse out into the hoofs and guns of the storm.,modern
I cross Lincoln Park on a winter night when the snow is falling.,modern
"Lincoln in bronze stands among the white lines of snow, his bronze forehead meeting soft echoes of the newsies crying forty thousand men are dead along the Yser, his bronze ears listening to the mumbled roar of the city at his bronze feet.",modern
"A lithe Indian on a bronze pony, Shakespeare seated with long legs in bronze, Garibaldi in a bronze cape, they hold places in the cold, lonely snow to-night on their pedestals and so they will hold them past midnight and into the dawn.",modern
Not in that wasted garden,modern
Where bodies are drawn into grass,modern
"That feeds no flocks, and into evergreens",modern
That bear no fruit ,modern
There where along the shaded walks,modern
"Vain sighs are heard,",modern
And vainer dreams are dreamed,modern
Of close communion with departed souls ,modern
But here under the apple tree,modern
I loved and watched and pruned,modern
With gnarled hands,modern
"In the long, long years;",modern
Here under the roots of this northern-spy,modern
"To move in the chemic change and circle of life,",modern
"Into the soil and into the flesh of the tree,",modern
And into the living epitaphs,modern
"Of redder apples!What large, dark hands are those at the window",modern
"Lifted, grasping the golden light",modern
Which weaves its way through the creeper leaves,modern
To my heart's delight?,modern
"Ah, only the leaves! But in the west,",modern
In the west I see a redness come,modern
Over the evening's burning breast ,modern
'Tis the wound of love goes home!,modern
The woodbine creeps abroad,modern
Calling low to her lover:,modern
The sun-lit flirt who all the day,modern
Has poised above her lips in play,modern
"And stolen kisses, shallow and gay",modern
"Of pollen, now has gone away",modern
" She woos the moth with her sweet, low word,",modern
And when above her his broad wings hover,modern
Then her bright breast she will uncover,modern
And yield her honey-drop to her lover.,modern
"Into the yellow, evening glow",modern
"Saunters a man from the farm below,",modern
"Leans, and looks in at the low-built shed",modern
Where hangs the swallow's marriage bed.,modern
The bird lies warm against the wall.,modern
She glances quick her startled eyes,modern
"Towards him, then she turns away",modern
"Her small head, making warm display",modern
Of red upon the throat. His terrors sway,modern
"Her out of the nest's warm, busy ball,",modern
Whose plaintive cry is heard as she flies,modern
In one blue stoop from out the sties,modern
Into the evening's empty hall.,modern
"Oh, water-hen, beside the rushes",modern
"Hide your quaint, unfading blushes,",modern
"Still your quick tail, and lie as dead,",modern
Till the distance folds over his ominous tread.,modern
"The rabbit presses back her ears,",modern
"Turns back her liquid, anguished eyes",modern
And crouches low: then with wild spring,modern
Spurts from the terror of his oncoming,modern
"To be choked back, the wire ring",modern
Her frantic effort throttling:,modern
Piteous brown ball of quivering fears!,modern
"Ah soon in his large, hard hands she dies,",modern
And swings all loose to the swing of his walk.,modern
Yet calm and kindly are his eyes,modern
And ready to open in brown surprise,modern
Should I not answer to his talk,modern
Or should he my tears surmise.,modern
"I hear his hand on the latch, and rise from my chair",modern
Watching the door open: he flashes bare,modern
"His strong teeth in a smile, and flashes his eyes",modern
In a smile like triumph upon me; then careless-wise,modern
He flings the rabbit soft on the table board,modern
"And comes towards me: ah, the uplifted sword",modern
"Of his hand against my bosom, and oh, the broad",modern
Blade of his hand that raises my face to applaud,modern
His coming: he raises up my face to him,modern
"And caresses my mouth with his fingers, which still smell grim",modern
"Of the rabbit's fur! God, I am caught in a snare!",modern
"I know not what fine wire is round my throat,",modern
I only know I let him finger there,modern
"My pulse of life, letting him nose like a stoat",modern
Who sniffs with joy before he drinks the blood:,modern
"And down his mouth comes to my mouth, and down",modern
His dark bright eyes descend like a fiery hood,modern
"Upon my mind: his mouth meets mine, and a flood",modern
"Of sweet fire sweeps across me, so I drown",modern
"Within him, die, and find death good.",modern
"See, the grass is full of stars,",modern
Fallen in their brightness;,modern
"Hearts they have of shining gold,",modern
Rays of shining whiteness.,modern
"Buttercups have honeyed hearts,",modern
"Bees they love the clover,",modern
But I love the daisies' dance,modern
All the meadow over.,modern
"Blow, O blow, you happy winds,",modern
"Singing summer's praises,",modern
Up the field and down the field,modern
A-dancing with the daisies.,modern
"This spring as it comes bursts up in bonfires green,",modern
"Wild puffing of emerald trees, and flame-filled bushes,",modern
Thorn-blossom lifting in wreaths of smoke between,modern
"Where the wood fumes up and the watery, flickering rushes.",modern
"I am amazed at this spring, this conflagration",modern
"Of green fires lit on the soil of the earth, this blaze",modern
"Of growing, and sparks that puff in wild gyration,",modern
Faces of people streaming across my gaze.,modern
"And I, what fountain of fire am I among",modern
This leaping combustion of spring? My spirit is tossed,modern
About like a shadow buffeted in the throng,modern
"Of flames, a shadow that's gone astray, and is lost.I never knew the earth had so much gold",modern
"The fields run over with it, and this hill",modern
"Hoary and old,",modern
Is young with buoyant blooms that flame and thrill.,modern
"Such golden fires, such yellowlo, how good",modern
"This spendthrift world, and what a lavish God!",modern
"This fringe of wood,",modern
Blazing with buttercup and goldenrod.,modern
"You too, beloved, are changed. Again I see",modern
"Your face grow mystical, as on that night",modern
"You turned to me,",modern
And all the trembling worldand youwere white.,modern
"Aye, you are touched; your singing lips grow dumb;",modern
"The fields absorb you, color you entire . . .",modern
And you become,modern
A goddess standing in a world of fire!The fog comes,modern
on little cat feet.,modern
It sits looking,modern
over harbor and city,modern
on silent haunches,modern
and then moves on.,modern
When she rises in the morning,modern
I linger to watch her;,modern
She spreads the bath-cloth underneath the window,modern
And the sunbeams catch her,modern
"Glistening white on the shoulders,",modern
While down her sides the mellow,modern
Golden shadow glows as,modern
"She stoops to the sponge, and her swung breasts",modern
Sway like full-blown yellow,modern
Gloire de Dijon roses.,modern
"She drips herself with water, and her shoulders",modern
"Glisten as silver, they crumple up",modern
"Like wet and falling roses, and I listen",modern
For the sluicing of their rain-dishevelled petals.,modern
In the window full of sunlight,modern
Concentrates her golden shadow,modern
"Fold on fold, until it glows as",modern
"Mellow as the glory roses.Pray why are you so bare, so bare,",modern
"Oh, bough of the old oak-tree;",modern
"And why, when I go through the shade you throw,",modern
Runs a shudder over me?,modern
"My leaves were green as the best, I trow,",modern
"And sap ran free in my veins,",modern
But I say in the moonlight dim and weird,modern
A guiltless victim's pains.,modern
I bent me down to hear his sigh;,modern
"I shook with his gurgling moan,",modern
"And I trembled sore when they rode away,",modern
And left him here alone.,modern
"They'd charged him with the old, old crime,",modern
And set him fast in jail:,modern
"Oh, why does the dog howl all night long,",modern
And why does the night wind wail?,modern
"He prayed his prayer and he swore his oath,",modern
And he raised his hand to the sky;,modern
"But the beat of hoofs smote on his ear,",modern
And the steady tread drew nigh.,modern
"Who is it rides by night, by night,",modern
Over the moonlit road?,modern
"And what is the spur that keeps the pace,",modern
What is the galling goad?,modern
"And now they beat at the prison door,",modern
"Ho, keeper, do not stay!",modern
"We are friends of him whom you hold within,",modern
And we fain would take him away,modern
From those who ride fast on our heels,modern
With mind to do him wrong;,modern
"They have no care for his innocence,",modern
And the rope they bear is long.,modern
"They have fooled the jailer with lying words,",modern
They have fooled the man with lies;,modern
"The bolts unbar, the locks are drawn,",modern
And the great door open flies.,modern
"Now they have taken him from the jail,",modern
"And hard and fast they ride,",modern
"And the leader laughs low down in his throat,",modern
As they halt my trunk beside.,modern
"Oh, the judge, he wore a mask of black,",modern
"And the doctor one of white,",modern
"And the minister, with his oldest son,",modern
Was curiously bedight.,modern
"Oh, foolish man, why weep you now?",modern
"'Tis but a little space,",modern
And the time will come when these shall dread,modern
The mem'ry of your face.,modern
"I feel the rope against my bark,",modern
"And the weight of him in my grain,",modern
I feel in the throe of his final woe,modern
The touch of my own last pain.,modern
And never more shall leaves come forth,modern
On the bough that bears the ban;,modern
"I am burned with dread, I am dried and dead,",modern
From the curse of a guiltless man.,modern
"And ever the judge rides by, rides by,",modern
"And goes to hunt the deer,",modern
And ever another rides his soul,modern
In the guise of a mortal fear.,modern
"And ever the man he rides me hard,",modern
And never a night stays he;,modern
"For I feel his curse as a haunted bough,",modern
On the trunk of a haunted tree.When I am dead and over me bright April,modern
"Shakes out her rain-drenched hair,",modern
"Tho' you should lean above me broken-hearted,",modern
I shall not care.,modern
"I shall have peace, as leafy trees are peaceful",modern
"When rain bends down the bough,",modern
And I shall be more silent and cold-hearted,modern
Than you are now.in Just-,modern
spring when the world is mud-,modern
luscious the little,modern
lame balloonman,modern
whistles far and wee,modern
and eddieandbill come,modern
running from marbles and,modern
piracies and it's,modern
spring,modern
when the world is puddle-wonderful,modern
the queer,modern
old balloonman whistles,modern
far and wee,modern
and bettyandisbel come dancing,modern
from hop-scotch and jump-rope and,modern
it's spring and the goat-footed balloonMan whistles,modern
"I will arise and go now, and go to Innisfree,",modern
"And a small cabin build there, of clay and wattles made;",modern
"Nine bean-rows will I have there, a hive for the honey-bee,",modern
And live alone in the bee-loud glade.,modern
"And I shall have some peace there, for peace comes dropping slow,",modern
Dropping from the veils of the morning to where the cricket sings;,modern
"There midnights all a glimmer, and noon a purple glow,",modern
And evening full of the linnets wings.,modern
"I will arise and go now, for always night and day",modern
I hear lake water lapping with low sounds by the shore;,modern
"While I stand on the roadway, or on the pavements grey,",modern
I hear it in the deep hearts core.,modern
little tree,modern
little silent Christmas tree,modern
you are so little,modern
you are more like a flower,modern
who found you in the green forest,modern
and were you very sorry to come away?,modern
see i will comfort you,modern
because you smell so sweetly,modern
i will kiss your cool bark,modern
and hug you safe and tight,modern
"just as your mother would,",modern
only don't be afraid,modern
look the spangles,modern
that sleep all the year in a dark box,modern
"dreaming of being taken out and allowed to shine,",modern
"the balls the chains red and gold the fluffy threads,",modern
put up your little arms,modern
and i'll give them all to you to hold,modern
every finger shall have its ring,modern
and there won't be a single place dark or unhappy,modern
then when you're quite dressed,modern
you'll stand in the window for everyone to see,modern
and how they'll stare!,modern
oh but you'll be very proud,modern
and my little sister and i will take hands,modern
and looking up at our beautiful tree,modern
we'll dance and sing,modern
Rugged and straight he stood; his body steeled,modern
With stubbornness and age. We met his eyes,modern
"That never flinched or turned to compromise,",modern
"And Luck, he cried, good luck!and waved an arm,",modern
"Knotted and sailor-like, such as no farm",modern
In all of Maine could boast of; and away,modern
He turned again to pitch his new-cut hay...,modern
We walked on leisurely until a bend,modern
"Showed him once more, now working toward the end",modern
Of one great path; wearing his eighty years,modern
Like banners lifted in a wind of cheers.,modern
Then we turned off abruptlytook the road,modern
"Cutting the village, the one with the commanding",modern
View of the river. And we strode,modern
More briskly now to the long pier that showed,modern
Where the frail boats were kept at Indian Landing.,modern
In the canoe we stepped; our paddles dipped,modern
"Leisurely downwards, and the slim bark slipped",modern
More on than in the water. Smoothly then,modern
"We shot its nose against the rippling current,",modern
Feeling the rising rivers half-deterrent,modern
Pull on the paddle as we turned the blade,modern
To keep from swerving round; while we delayed,modern
To watch the curious wave-eaten locks;,modern
"Or pass, with lazy turns, the picnic-rocks....",modern
"Blue eels flew under us, and fishes darted",modern
A thousand ways; the once broad channel shrunk.,modern
And over us the wise and noble-hearted,modern
"Twilight leaned down; the sunset mists were parted,",modern
"And we, with thoughts on tiptoe, slunk",modern
"Down the green, twisting alleys of the Kennebunk,",modern
Motionless in the meadows,modern
"The trees, the rocks, the cows...",modern
And quiet dripped from the shadows,modern
Like rain from heavy boughs.,modern
The tree-toads started ringing,modern
Their ceaseless silver bells;,modern
A land-locked breeze came swinging,modern
Its censer of earthy smells.,modern
The rivers tiny canon,modern
Stretched into dusky lands;,modern
Like a dark and silent companion,modern
Evening held out her hands.,modern
Hushed were the dawns bravados;,modern
Loud noon was a silenced cry,modern
And quiet slipped from the shadows,modern
As stars slip out of the sky...,modern
"It must have been an hour more, or later,",modern
"When, tramping homeward through the piney wood,",modern
We felt the years fly back; the brotherhood,modern
Of forests took usand we saw the satyr!,modern
"There in a pool, up to his neck, he stood",modern
"And grinned to see us stare, incredulous",modern
Too startled to remember fear or flight.,modern
"Feeling the menace in the crafty night,",modern
"We turned to runwhen lo, he called to us!",modern
Using our very names he called. We drew,modern
With creaking courage down the avenue,modern
"Of birches till we saw, with clearing sight,",modern
"(No longer through a tricky, pale-green light)",modern
"Familiar turns and shrubs, the friendly path,",modern
And Farmer Boothby in his woodland bath!,modern
The woods became his background; every tree,modern
"Seemed part of him, and stood erect, and shared",modern
The beauty of that gnarled serenity;,modern
The quiet vigor of age that smiled and squared,modern
Its shoulders against Time ... And even night,modern
"Flowed in and out of him, as though content",modern
With such a native element;,modern
Happy to move about a spirit quite,modern
"As old, as placid and as confident...",modern
Sideways we turned. Still glistening and unclad,modern
"He leaped up on the bank, light as a lad,",modern
His body in the moonlight dripping stars...,modern
"We went on homeward, through the pasture-bars.Moonmoth and grasshopper that flee our page",modern
"And still wing on, untarnished of the name",modern
We pinion to your bodies to assuage,modern
Our envy of your freedomwe must maim,modern
"Because we are usurpers, and chagrined",modern
And take the wing and scar it in the hand.,modern
"Names we have, even, to clap on the wind;",modern
"But we must die, as you, to understand.",modern
"I dreamed that all men dropped their names, and sang",modern
"As only they can praise, who build their days",modern
"With fin and hoof, with wing and sweetened fang",modern
Struck free and holy in one Name always.,modern
She has no need to fear the fall,modern
Of harvest from the laddered reach,modern
"Of orchards, nor the tide gone ebbing",modern
From the steep beach.,modern
Nor hold to pain's effrontery,modern
"Her body's bulwark, stern and savage,",modern
"Nor be a glass, where to forsee",modern
Another's ravage.,modern
"What she has gathered, and what lost,",modern
She will not find to lose again.,modern
"She is possessed by time, who once",modern
Was loved by men.,modern
The winter evening settles down,modern
With smell of steaks in passageways.,modern
Six oclock.,modern
The burnt-out ends of smoky days.,modern
And now a gusty shower wraps,modern
The grimy scraps,modern
Of withered leaves about your feet,modern
And newspapers from vacant lots;,modern
The showers beat,modern
"On broken blinds and chimney-pots,",modern
And at the corner of the street,modern
A lonely cab-horse steams and stamps.,modern
And then the lighting of the lamps.,modern
The morning comes to consciousness,modern
Of faint stale smells of beer,modern
From the sawdust-trampled street,modern
With all its muddy feet that press,modern
To early coffee-stands.,modern
With the other masquerades,modern
"That time resumes,",modern
One thinks of all the hands,modern
That are raising dingy shades,modern
In a thousand furnished rooms.,modern
"You tossed a blanket from the bed,",modern
"You lay upon your back, and waited;",modern
"You dozed, and watched the night revealing",modern
The thousand sordid images,modern
Of which your soul was constituted;,modern
They flickered against the ceiling.,modern
And when all the world came back,modern
And the light crept up between the shutters,modern
"And you heard the sparrows in the gutters,",modern
You had such a vision of the street,modern
As the street hardly understands;,modern
"Sitting along the beds edge, where",modern
"You curled the papers from your hair,",modern
Or clasped the yellow soles of feet,modern
In the palms of both soiled hands.,modern
His soul stretched tight across the skies,modern
"That fade behind a city block,",modern
Or trampled by insistent feet,modern
At four and five and six oclock;,modern
"And short square fingers stuffing pipes,",modern
"And evening newspapers, and eyes",modern
"Assured of certain certainties,",modern
The conscience of a blackened street,modern
Impatient to assume the world.,modern
I am moved by fancies that are curled,modern
"Around these images, and cling:",modern
The notion of some infinitely gentle,modern
Infinitely suffering thing.,modern
"Wipe your hand across your mouth, and laugh;",modern
The worlds revolve like ancient women,modern
"Gathering fuel in vacant lots.The willows carried a slow sound,",modern
A sarabande the wind mowed on the mead.,modern
I could never remember,modern
"That seething, steady leveling of the marshes",modern
Till age had brought me to the sea.,modern
"Flags, weeds. And remembrance of steep alcoves",modern
Where cypresses shared the noons,modern
Tyranny; they drew me into hades almost.,modern
And mammoth turtles climbing sulphur dreams,modern
"Yielded, while sun-silt rippled them",modern
Asunder ...,modern
How much I would have bartered! the black gorge,modern
And all the singular nestings in the hills,modern
Where beavers learn stitch and tooth.,modern
The pond I entered once and quickly fled,modern
I remember now its singing willow rim.,modern
"And finally, in that memory all things nurse;",modern
After the city that I finally passed,modern
With scalding unguents spread and smoking darts,modern
The monsoon cut across the delta,modern
"At gulf gates ... There, beyond the dykes",modern
"I heard wind flaking sapphire, like this summer,",modern
And willows could not hold more steady sound.Twelve o'clock.,modern
Along the reaches of the street,modern
"Held in a lunar synthesis,",modern
Whispering lunar incantations,modern
Dissolve the floors of memory,modern
"And all its clear relations,",modern
"Its divisions and precisions,",modern
Every street lamp that I pass,modern
"Beats like a fatalistic drum,",modern
And through the spaces of the dark,modern
Midnight shakes the memory,modern
As a madman shakes a dead geranium.,modern
"Half-past one,",modern
"The street lamp sputtered,",modern
"The street lamp muttered,",modern
"The street lamp said, ""Regard that woman",modern
Who hesitates towards you in the light of the door,modern
Which opens on her like a grin.,modern
You see the border of her dress,modern
"Is torn and stained with sand,",modern
And you see the corner of her eye,modern
"Twists like a crooked pin.""",modern
The memory throws up high and dry,modern
A crowd of twisted things;,modern
A twisted branch upon the beach,modern
"Eaten smooth, and polished",modern
As if the world gave up,modern
"The secret of its skeleton,",modern
Stiff and white.,modern
"A broken spring in a factory yard,",modern
Rust that clings to the form that the strength has left,modern
Hard and curled and ready to snap.,modern
"Half-past two,",modern
"The street lamp said,",modern
"Remark the cat which flattens itself in the gutter,
Slips out its tongue
And devours a morsel of rancid butter.",modern
"So the hand of a child, automatic,",modern
Slipped out and pocketed a toy that was running along the quay.,modern
I could see nothing behind that child's eye.,modern
I have seen eyes in the street,modern
"Trying to peer through lighted shutters,",modern
"And a crab one afternoon in a pool,",modern
"An old crab with barnacles on his back,",modern
Gripped the end of a stick which I held him.,modern
"Half-past three,",modern
"The lamp sputtered,",modern
The lamp muttered in the dark.,modern
The lamp hummed:,modern
Regard the moon,modern
La lune ne garde aucune rancune,modern
She winks a feeble eye,modern
She smiles into corners.,modern
She smoothes the hair of the grass.,modern
The moon has lost her memory.,modern
A washed-out smallpox cracks her face,modern
Her hand twists a paper rose,modern
That smells of dust and old Cologne,modern
She is alone,modern
With all the old nocturnal smells,modern
That cross and cross across her brain.,modern
The reminiscence comes,modern
Of sunless dry geraniums,modern
"And dust in crevices,",modern
"Smells of chestnuts in the streets,",modern
"And female smells in shuttered rooms,",modern
And cigarettes in corridors,modern
"And cocktail smells in bars.""",modern
"The lamp said,",modern
"Four o'clock,",modern
Here is the number on the door.,modern
Memory!,modern
"You have the key,",modern
"The little lamp spreads a ring on the stair,",modern
Mount.,modern
"The bed is open; the tooth-brush hangs on the wall,",modern
"Put your shoes at the door, sleep, prepare for life.",modern
The last twist of the knife.,modern
"Out of the winds' and the waves' riot,",modern
"Out of the loud foam,",modern
He has put in to a great quiet,modern
And a still home.,modern
Here he may lie at ease and wonder,modern
"Why the old ship waits,",modern
And hark for the surge and the strong thunder,modern
"Of the full Straits,",modern
"And look for the fishing fleet at morning,",modern
"Shadows like lost souls,",modern
Slide through the fog where the seal's warning,modern
"Betrays the shoals,",modern
And watch for the deep-sea liner climbing,modern
"Out of the bright West,",modern
With a salmon-sky and her wake shining,modern
"Like a tern's breast, ",modern
And never know he is done for ever,modern
"With the old sea's pride,",modern
Borne from the fight and the full endeavour,modern
"On an ebb tide.Maurice, weep not, I am not here under this pine tree.",modern
"The balmy air of spring whispers through the sweet grass,",modern
"The stars sparkle, the whippoorwill calls,",modern
"But thou grievest, while my soul lies rapturous",modern
In the blest Nirvana of eternal light!,modern
"Go to the good heart that is my husband,",modern
Who broods upon what he calls our guilty love: i,modern
"Tell him that my love for you, no less than my love for him",modern
Wrought out my destiny i that through the flesh,modern
"I won spirit, and through spirit, peace.",modern
"There is no marriage in heaven,",modern
But there is love.,modern
The earth builds on the earth,modern
Castles and towers;,modern
The earth saith of the earth:,modern
All shall be ours.,modern
"Yea, though they plan and reap",modern
"The rye and the corn,",modern
"Lo, they were bond to Sleep",modern
Ere they were born.,modern
"Yea, though the blind earth sows",modern
"For the fruit and the sheaf,",modern
They shall harvest the leaf of the rose,modern
And the dust of the leaf.,modern
Pride of the sword and power,modern
Are theirs at their need,modern
Who shall rule but the root of the flower,modern
The fall of the seed.,modern
They who follow the flesh,modern
"In splendour and tears,",modern
They shall rest and clothe them afresh,modern
In the fulness of years.,modern
From the dream of the dust they came,modern
As the dawn set free.,modern
They shall pass as the flower of the flame,modern
Or the foam of the sea.,modern
The earth builds on the earth,modern
Castles and towers.,modern
The earth saith of the earth:,modern
"All shall be ours.May I for my own self song's truth reckon,",modern
"Journey's jargon, how I in harsh days",modern
Hardship endured oft.,modern
"Bitter breast-cares have I abided,",modern
"Known on my keel many a care's hold,",modern
"And dire sea-surge, and there I oft spent",modern
Narrow nightwatch nigh the ship's head,modern
"While she tossed close to cliffs. Coldly afflicted,",modern
My feet were by frost benumbed.,modern
Chill its chains are; chafing sighs,modern
Hew my heart round and hunger begot,modern
Mere-weary mood. Lest man know not,modern
"That he on dry land loveliest liveth,",modern
"List how I, care-wretched, on ice-cold sea,",modern
"Weathered the winter, wretched outcast",modern
Deprived of my kinsmen;,modern
"Hung with hard ice-flakes, where hail-scur flew,",modern
There I heard naught save the harsh sea,modern
"And ice-cold wave, at whiles the swan cries,",modern
"Did for my games the gannet's clamour,",modern
"Sea-fowls, loudness was for me laughter,",modern
The mews' singing all my mead-drink.,modern
"Storms, on the stone-cliffs beaten, fell on the stern",modern
In icy feathers; full oft the eagle screamed,modern
With spray on his pinion.,modern
Not any protector,modern
May make merry man faring needy.,modern
"This he little believes, who aye in winsome life",modern
"Abides 'mid burghers some heavy business,",modern
"Wealthy and wine-flushed, how I weary oft",modern
Must bide above brine.,modern
"Neareth nightshade, snoweth from north,",modern
"Frost froze the land, hail fell on earth then",modern
Corn of the coldest. Nathless there knocketh now,modern
The heart's thought that I on high streams,modern
The salt-wavy tumult traverse alone.,modern
Moaneth alway my mind's lust,modern
"That I fare forth, that I afar hence",modern
Seek out a foreign fastness.,modern
"For this there's no mood-lofty man over earth's midst,",modern
"Not though he be given his good, but will have in his youth greed;",modern
"Nor his deed to the daring, nor his king to the faithful",modern
But shall have his sorrow for sea-fare,modern
Whatever his lord will.,modern
"He hath not heart for harping, nor in ring-having",modern
"Nor winsomeness to wife, nor world's delight",modern
"Nor any whit else save the wave's slash,",modern
Yet longing comes upon him to fare forth on the water.,modern
"Bosque taketh blossom, cometh beauty of berries,",modern
"Fields to fairness, land fares brisker,",modern
"All this admonisheth man eager of mood,",modern
The heart turns to travel so that he then thinks,modern
On flood-ways to be far departing.,modern
"Cuckoo calleth with gloomy crying,",modern
"He singeth summerward, bodeth sorrow,",modern
The bitter heart's blood. Burgher knows not ,modern
He the prosperous man  what some perform,modern
Where wandering them widest draweth.,modern
"So that but now my heart burst from my breast-lock,",modern
"My mood 'mid the mere-flood,",modern
"Over the whale's acre, would wander wide.",modern
"On earth's shelter cometh oft to me,",modern
"Eager and ready, the crying lone-flyer,",modern
"Whets for the whale-path the heart irresistibly,",modern
O'er tracks of ocean; seeing that anyhow,modern
My lord deems to me this dead life,modern
"On loan and on land, I believe not",modern
That any earth-weal eternal standeth,modern
Save there be somewhat calamitous,modern
"That, ere a man's tide go, turn it to twain.",modern
Disease or oldness or sword-hate,modern
Beats out the breath from doom-gripped body.,modern
"And for this, every earl whatever, for those speaking after ",modern
"Laud of the living, boasteth some last word,",modern
"That he will work ere he pass onward,",modern
"Frame on the fair earth 'gainst foes his malice,",modern
"Daring ado, ...",modern
So that all men shall honour him after,modern
"And his laud beyond them remain 'mid the English,",modern
"Aye, for ever, a lasting life's-blast,",modern
Delight mid the doughty.,modern
"Days little durable,",modern
"And all arrogance of earthen riches,",modern
There come now no kings nor Csars,modern
Nor gold-giving lords like those gone.,modern
"Howe'er in mirth most magnified,",modern
"Whoe'er lived in life most lordliest,",modern
"Drear all this excellence, delights undurable!",modern
"Waneth the watch, but the world holdeth.",modern
Tomb hideth trouble. The blade is layed low.,modern
Earthly glory ageth and seareth.,modern

"But age fares against him, his face paleth,",modern
"Grey-haired he groaneth, knows gone companions,",modern
"Lordly men are to earth o'ergiven,",modern
"Nor may he then the flesh-cover, whose life ceaseth,",modern
"Nor eat the sweet nor feel the sorry,",modern
"Nor stir hand nor think in mid heart,",modern
"And though he strew the grave with gold,",modern
"His born brothers, their buried bodies",modern
Be an unlikely treasure hoard.Out in the sky the great dark clouds are massing;,modern
"I look far out into the pregnant night,",modern
Where I can hear a solemn booming gun,modern
"And catch the gleaming of a random light,",modern
"That tells me that the ship I seek is passing, passing.",modern
My tearful eyes my soul's deep hurt are glassing;,modern
For I would hail and check that ship of ships.,modern
"I stretch my hands imploring, cry aloud,",modern
"My voice falls dead a foot from mine own lips,",modern
"And but its ghost doth reach that vessel, passing, passing.",modern
"O Earth, O Sky, O Ocean, both surpassing,",modern
"O heart of mine, O soul that dreads the dark!",modern
Is there no hope for me? Is there no way,modern
That I may sight and check that speeding bark,modern

Had blotted out man's image and his cry.,modern
A girl arose that had red mournful lips,modern
"And seemed the greatness of the world in tears,   ",modern
Doomed like Odysseus and the labouring ships   ,modern
And proud as Priam murdered with his peers;,modern
"Arose, and on the instant clamorous eaves,   ",modern
"A climbing moon upon an empty sky,   ",modern
"And all that lamentation of the leaves,   ",modern
"Could but compose man's image and his cry. Now in the West the slender moon lies low,",modern
"And now Orion glimmers through the trees,",modern
"Clearing the earth with even pace and slow,",modern
"And now the stately-moving Pleiades,",modern
In that soft infinite darkness overhead,modern
Hang jewel-wise upon a silver thread.,modern
"And all the lonelier stars that have their place,",modern
"Calm lamps within the distant southern sky,",modern
"And planet-dust upon the edge of space,",modern
"Look down upon the fretful world, and I",modern
Look up to outer vastness unafraid,modern
And see the stars which sang when earth was made.,modern
I spot the hills,modern
With yellow balls in autumn.,modern
I light the prairie cornfields,modern
Orange and tawny gold clusters,modern
And I am called pumpkins.,modern
On the last of October,modern
When dusk is fallen,modern
Children join hands,modern
And circle round me,modern
Singing ghost songs,modern
And love to the harvest moon;,modern
I am a jack-o'-lantern,modern
With terrible teeth,modern
And the children know,modern
I am fooling.Green miles of leafy peace are spread,modern
"Over these ranks, unseen and serried;",modern
Screening the trenches with their dead,modern
And living men already buried.,modern
"The rains beat down, the torrents flow",modern
Into each cold and huddling cave;,modern
"And over them the beet-fields grow,",modern
A fortress gentle as a grave.,modern
"Morose, impatient, sick at heart,",modern
"With rasping nerves and twitching muscles,",modern
We cannot even sleep; we start,modern
With every twig that snaps or rustles.,modern
Sought always by an unseen foe,modern
Over our heads the bullets fly;,modern
"But more than these, we fear the snow,",modern
The silent shrapnel of the sky.,modern
"Yonder our colonel stalks and grieves,",modern
Meeting the storm with thoughts more stormy;,modern
"But we, we sit and watch the leaves",modern
"Fall down, a torn and crumpled army.",modern
"We mourn for every leaf that lies,",modern
As though it were a comrade slain;,modern
Each was a shelter from the eyes,modern
Of every prying aeroplane. . . ,modern
"And in its cloudy uniform,",modern
"Stilling the cannons earthly thunder,",modern
The huge artillery of the storm,modern
Plows through the land and pulls it under.,modern
"The rain beats down, until the slow",modern
And slipping earth resists no more. . .,modern
And over them the beets will grow,modern
Ranker and redder than before.,modern
"The quick sparks on the gorse bushes are leaping,",modern
Little jets of sunlight-texture imitating flame;,modern
"Above them, exultant, the peewits are sweeping:",modern
They are lords of the desolate wastes of sadness their screamings proclaim.,modern
"Rabbits, handfuls of brown earth, lie",modern
Low-rounded on the mournful grass they have bitten down to the quick.,modern
"Are they asleep?  Are they alive?  Now see, when I",modern
Move my arms the hill bursts and heaves under their spurting kick.,modern
"The common flaunts bravely; but below, from the rushes",modern
Crowds of glittering king-cups surge to challenge the blossoming bushes;,modern
There the lazy streamlet pushes,modern
"Its curious course mildly; here it wakes again, leaps, laughs, and gushes.",modern
"Into a deep pond, an old sheep-dip,",modern
"Dark, overgrown with willows, cool, with the brook ebbing through so slow,",modern
"Naked on the steep, soft lip",modern
Of the bank I stand watching my own white shadow quivering to and fro.,modern
What if the gorse flowers shrivelled and kissing were lost?,modern
"Without the pulsing waters, where were the marigolds and the songs of the brook!",modern
If my veins and my breasts with love embossed,modern
"Withered, my insolent soul would be gone like flowers that the hot wind took.",modern
"So my soul like a passionate woman turns,",modern
"Filled with remorseful terror to the man she scorned, and her love",modern
"For myself in my own eyes' laughter burns,",modern
Runs ecstatic over the pliant folds rippling down to my belly from the breast-lights above.,modern
"Over my sunlit skin the warm, clinging air,",modern
"Rich with the songs of seven larks singing at once, goes kissing me glad.",modern
And the soul of the wind and my blood compare,modern
"Their wandering happiness, and the wind, wasted in liberty, drifts on and is sad.",modern
"Oh but the water loves me and folds me,",modern
"Plays with me, sways me, lifts me and sinks me as though it were living blood,",modern
"Blood of a heaving woman who holds me,",modern
"Owning my supple body a rare glad thing, supremely good.",modern
The quick sparks on the gorse-bushes are leaping,modern
Little jets of sunlight texture imitating flame;,modern
"Above them, exultant, the peewits are sweeping:",modern
"They have triumphed again o'er the ages, their screamings proclaim.",modern
"Rabbits, handfuls of brown earth, lie",modern
Low-rounded on the mournful turf they have bitten down to the quick.,modern
"Are they asleep?  are they living?  Now see, when I",modern
"Lift my arms, the hill bursts and heaves under their spurting kick!",modern
"The common flaunts bravely; but below, from the rushes",modern
Crowds of glittering king-cups surge to challenge the blossoming bushes;,modern
There the lazy streamlet pushes,modern
"His bent course mildly; here wakes again, leaps, laughs, and gushes",modern
"Into a deep pond, an old sheep-dip,",modern
"Dark, overgrown with willows, cool, with the brook ebbing through so slow;",modern
"Naked on the steep, soft lip",modern
Of the turf I stand watching my own white shadow quivering to and fro.,modern
"What if the gorse-flowers shrivelled, and I were gone?",modern
"What if the waters ceased, where were the marigolds then, and the gudgeon?",modern
What is this thing that I look down upon?,modern
"White on the water wimples my shadow, strains like a dog on a string, to run on.",modern
"How it looks back, like a white dog to its master!",modern
"I on the bank all substance, my shadow all shadow looking up to me, looking back!",modern
"And the water runs, and runs faster, runs faster,",modern
"And the white dog dances and quivers, I am holding his cord quite slack.",modern
"But how splendid it is to be substance, here!",modern
"My shadow is neither here nor there; but I, I am royally here!",modern
I am here! I am here! screams the peewit; the may-blobs burst out in a laugh as they hear!,modern
Here! flick the rabbits. Here! pants the gorse. Here! say the insects far and near.,modern
"Over my skin in the sunshine, the warm, clinging air",modern
"Flushed with the songs of seven larks singing at once, goes kissing me glad.",modern
You are here! You are here! We have found you! Everywhere,modern
"We sought you substantial, you touchstone of caresses, you naked lad!",modern
"Oh but the water loves me and folds me,",modern
"Plays with me, sways me, lifts me and sinks me, murmurs: Oh marvellous stuff!",modern
No longer shadow!  and it holds me,modern
"Close, and it rolls me, enfolds me, touches me, as if never it could touch me enough.",modern
"Sun, but in substance, yellow water-blobs!",modern
"Wings and feathers on the crying, mysterious ages, peewits wheeling!",modern
"All that is right, all that is good; all that is God takes substance! a rabbit lobs",modern
"In confirmation, I hear sevenfold lark-songs pealing.The trees are in their autumn beauty,",modern
"The woodland paths are dry,",modern
Under the October twilight the water,modern
Mirrors a still sky;,modern
Upon the brimming water among the stones,modern
Are nine-and-fifty swans.,modern
The nineteenth autumn has come upon me,modern
Since I first made my count;,modern
"I saw, before I had well finished,",modern
All suddenly mount,modern
And scatter wheeling in great broken rings,modern
Upon their clamorous wings.,modern
"I have looked upon those brilliant creatures,",modern
And now my heart is sore.,modern
"All's changed since I, hearing at twilight,",modern
"The first time on this shore,",modern
"The bell-beat of their wings above my head,",modern
Trod with a lighter tread.,modern
"Unwearied still, lover by lover,",modern
They paddle in the cold,modern
Companionable streams or climb the air;,modern
Their hearts have not grown old;,modern
"Passion or conquest, wander where they will,",modern
Attend upon them still.,modern
"But now they drift on the still water,",modern
"Mysterious, beautiful;",modern
"Among what rushes will they build,",modern
By what lake's edge or pool,modern
Delight men's eyes when I awake some day,modern
"To find they have flown away?Give me hunger,",modern
O you gods that sit and give,modern
The world its orders.,modern
"Give me hunger, pain and want,",modern
Shut me out with shame and failure,modern
"From your doors of gold and fame,",modern
"Give me your shabbiest, weariest hunger!",modern
"But leave me a little love,",modern
"A voice to speak to me in the day end,",modern
A hand to touch me in the dark room,modern
Breaking the long loneliness.,modern
In the dusk of day-shapes,modern
"Blurring the sunset,",modern
"One little wandering, western star",modern
Thrust out from the changing shores of shadow.,modern
"Let me go to the window,",modern
Watch there the day-shapes of dusk,modern
And wait and know the coming,modern
"Of a little love.Passing through huddled and ugly walls,",modern
By doorways where women haggard,modern
"Looked from their hunger-deep eyes,",modern
"Haunted with shadows of hunger-hands,",modern
"Out from the huddled and ugly walls,",modern
"I came sudden, at the city's edge,",modern
"On a blue burst of lake,",modern
Long lake waves breaking under the sun,modern
On a spray-flung curve of shore;,modern
"And a fluttering storm of gulls,",modern
Masses of great gray wings,modern
And flying white bellies,modern
Veering and wheeling free in the open.Desolate and lone,modern
All night long on the lake,modern
"Where fog trails and mist creeps,",modern
The whistle of a boat,modern
"Calls and cries unendingly,",modern
Like some lost child,modern
In tears and trouble,modern
Hunting the harbor's breast,modern
"And the harbor's eyes.Momus is the name men give your face,",modern
"The brag of its tone, like a long low steamboat whistle",modern
"Finding a way mid mist on a shoreland,",modern
"Where gray rocks let the salt water shatter spray Against horizons purple, silent.",modern
"Yes, Momus,",modern
Men have flung your face in bronze,modern
To gaze in gargoyle downward on a street-whirl of folk.,modern
"They were artists did this, shaped your sad mouth,",modern
"Gave you a tall forehead slanted with calm, broad wisdom;",modern
All your lips to the corners and your cheeks to the high bones,modern
"Thrown over and through with a smile that forever wishes and wishes, purple, silent, fled from all the iron things of life, evaded like a sought bandit, gone into dreams, by God.",modern
"I wonder, Momus,",modern
Whether shadows of the dead sit somewhere and look with deep laughter,modern
"On men who play in terrible earnest the old, known, solemn repetitions of history.",modern
"A droning monotone soft as sea laughter hovers from your kindliness of bronze,",modern
"You give me the human ease of a mountain peak, purple, silent;",modern
"Granite shoulders heaving above the earth curves,",modern
Careless eye-witness of the spawning tides of men and women,modern
"Swarming always in a drift of millions to the dust of toil, the salt of tears,",modern
And blood drops of undiminishing war.I shall foot it,modern
"Down the roadway in the dusk,",modern
Where shapes of hunger wander,modern
And the fugitives of pain go by.,modern
I shall foot it,modern
"In the silence of the morning,",modern
"See the night slur into dawn,",modern
Hear the slow great winds arise,modern
Where tall trees flank the way,modern
And shoulder toward the sky.,modern
The broken boulders by the road,modern
Shall not commemorate my ruin.,modern
Regret shall be the gravel under foot.,modern
I shall watch for,modern
Slim birds swift of wing,modern
That go where wind and ranks of thunder,modern
Drive the wild processionals of rain.,modern
The dust of the travelled road,modern
"Shall touch my hands and face.I have sat here happy in the gardens,",modern
Watching the still pool and the reeds,modern
And the dark clouds,modern
Which the wind of the upper air,modern
Tore like the green leafy boughs,modern
Of the divers-hued trees of late summer;,modern
But though I greatly delight,modern
"In these and the water-lilies,",modern
That which sets me nighest to weeping,modern
"Is the rose and white color of the smooth flag-stones,",modern
And the pale yellow grasses,modern
"Among them.Potuia, potuia",modern
"White grave goddess,",modern
"Pity my sadness,",modern
O silence of Paros.,modern
"I am not of these about thy feet,",modern
These garments and decorum;,modern
"I am thy brother,",modern
"Thy lover of aforetime crying to thee,",modern
And thou hearest me not.,modern
I have whispered thee in thy solitudes,modern
"Of our loves in Phrygia,",modern
The far ecstasy of burning noons,modern
When the fragile pipes,modern
"Ceased in the cypress shade,",modern
And the brown fingers of the shepherd,modern
Moved over slim shoulders;,modern
And only the cicada sang.,modern
I have told thee of the hills,modern
And the lisp of reeds,modern
"And the sun upon thy breasts,",modern
"And thou hearest me not,",modern
"Potuia, potuia",modern
Thou hearest me not.The ancient songs,modern
Pass deathward mournfully.,modern
"Cold lips that sing no more, and withered wreaths,",modern
"Regretful eyes, and drooping breasts and wings",modern
Symbols of ancient songs,modern
Mournfully passing,modern
"Down to the great white surges,",modern
Watched of none         - -,modern
Save the frail sea-birds,modern
"And the lithe pale girls,",modern
Daughters of Okeanos.,modern
And the songs pass,modern
From the green land,modern
Which lies upon the waves as a leaf,modern
On the flowers of hyacinth;,modern
"And they pass from the waters,",modern
"The manifold winds and the dim moon,",modern
"And they come,",modern
"Silently winging through soft Kimmerian dusk,",modern
To the quiet level lands,modern
"That she keeps for us all,",modern
That she wrought for us all for sleep,modern
In the silver days of the earth's dawning,modern
"Proserpine, daughter of Zeus.",modern
"And we turn from the Kuprian's breasts,",modern
"And we turn from thee,",modern
"Phoibos Apollon,",modern
And we turn from the music of old,modern
"And the hills that we loved and the meads,",modern
"And we turn from the fiery day,",modern
And the lips that were over-sweet;,modern
For silently,modern
"Brushing the fields with red-shod feet,",modern
With purple robe,modern
"Searing the flowers as with a sudden flame,",modern
"Death,",modern
Thou hast come upon us.,modern
And of all the ancient songs,modern
Passing to the swallow-blue halls,modern
"By the dark streams of Persephone,",modern
This only remains:,modern
"That in the end we turn to thee,",modern
"Death,",modern
"That we turn to thee, singing",modern
One last song.,modern
"O Death,",modern
Thou art an healing wind,modern
That blowest over white flowers,modern
A-tremble with dew;,modern
Thou art a wind flowing,modern
Over long leagues of lonely sea;,modern
Thou art the dusk and the fragrance;,modern
Thou art the lips of love mournfully smiling;,modern
Thou art the pale peace of one,modern
Satiate with old desires;,modern
"Thou art the silence of beauty,",modern
And we look no more for the morning;,modern
"We yearn no more for the sun,",modern
"Since with thy white hands,",modern
"Death,",modern
"Thou crownest us with the pallid chaplets,",modern
The slim colorless poppies,modern
Which in thy garden alone,modern
Softly thou gatherest.,modern
And silently;,modern
And with slow feet approaching;,modern
"And with bowed head and unlit eyes,",modern
We kneel before thee:,modern
"And thou, leaning towards us, Caressingly layest upon us",modern
"Flowers from thy thin cold hands,",modern
"And, smiling as a chaste woman Knowing love in her heart,",modern
Thou sealest our eyes,modern
And the illimitable quietude,modern
Comes gently upon us.,modern
"Why didst thou promise such a beauteous day,",renaissance
"And make me travel forth without my cloak,",renaissance
"To let base clouds oertake me in my way,",renaissance
Hiding thy bravery in their rotten smoke?,renaissance
"Tis not enough that through the cloud thou break,",renaissance
"To dry the rain on my storm-beaten face,",renaissance
For no man well of such a salve can speak,renaissance
That heals the wound and cures not the disgrace:,renaissance
Nor can thy shame give physic to my grief;,renaissance
"Though thou repent, yet I have still the loss:",renaissance
The offenders sorrow lends but weak relief,renaissance
To him that bears the strong offences cross.,renaissance
"Ah! but those tears are pearl which thy love sheds,",renaissance
And they are rich and ransom all ill deeds.,renaissance
"Weret aught to me I bore the canopy,",renaissance
"With my extern the outward honouring,",renaissance
"Or laid great bases for eternity,",renaissance
Which proves more short than waste or ruining;,renaissance
Have I not seen dwellers on form and favour,renaissance
"Lose all, and more, by paying too much rent,",renaissance
"For compound sweet forgoing simple savour,",renaissance
"Pitiful thrivers, in their gazing spent?",renaissance
"No;let me be obsequious in thy heart,",renaissance
"And take thou my oblation, poor but free,",renaissance
"Which is not mixd with seconds, knows no art,",renaissance
"But mutual render, only me for thee.",renaissance
"Hence, thou subornd informer! a true soul,",renaissance
"When most impeachd, stands least in thy control. ",renaissance
Let the bird of loudest lay,renaissance
On the sole Arabian tree,renaissance
"Herald sad and trumpet be,",renaissance
To whose sound chaste wings obey.,renaissance
"But thou shrieking harbinger,",renaissance
"Foul precurrer of the fiend,",renaissance
"Augur of the fever's end,",renaissance
To this troop come thou not near.,renaissance
From this session interdict,renaissance
"Every fowl of tyrant wing,",renaissance
"Save the eagle, feather'd king;",renaissance
Keep the obsequy so strict.,renaissance
"Let the priest in surplice white,",renaissance
"That defunctive music can,",renaissance
"Be the death-divining swan,",renaissance
Lest the requiem lack his right.,renaissance
"And thou treble-dated crow,",renaissance
That thy sable gender mak'st,renaissance
"With the breath thou giv'st and tak'st,",renaissance
'Mongst our mourners shalt thou go.,renaissance
Here the anthem doth commence:,renaissance
Love and constancy is dead;,renaissance
Phoenix and the Turtle fled,renaissance
In a mutual flame from hence.,renaissance
"So they lov'd, as love in twain",renaissance
Had the essence but in one;,renaissance
"Two distincts, division none:",renaissance
Number there in love was slain.,renaissance
"Hearts remote, yet not asunder;",renaissance
Distance and no space was seen,renaissance
'Twixt this Turtle and his queen:,renaissance
But in them it were a wonder.,renaissance
So between them love did shine,renaissance
That the Turtle saw his right,renaissance
Flaming in the Phoenix' sight:,renaissance
Either was the other's mine.,renaissance
Property was thus appalled,renaissance
That the self was not the same;,renaissance
Single nature's double name,renaissance
Neither two nor one was called.,renaissance
"Reason, in itself confounded,",renaissance
"Saw division grow together,",renaissance
"To themselves yet either neither,",renaissance
Simple were so well compounded;,renaissance
"That it cried, How true a twain",renaissance
Seemeth this concordant one!,renaissance
"Love has reason, reason none,",renaissance
If what parts can so remain.,renaissance
Whereupon it made this threne,renaissance
"To the Phoenix and the Dove,",renaissance
"Co-supremes and stars of love,",renaissance
As chorus to their tragic scene:,renaissance
"Beauty, truth, and rarity,",renaissance
"Grace in all simplicity,",renaissance
"Here enclos'd, in cinders lie.",renaissance
"Death is now the Phoenix' nest,",renaissance
And the Turtle's loyal breast,renaissance
"To eternity doth rest,",renaissance
Leaving no posterity:,renaissance
"'Twas not their infirmity,",renaissance
It was married chastity.,renaissance
Truth may seem but cannot be;,renaissance
Beauty brag but 'tis not she;,renaissance
Truth and beauty buried be.,renaissance
To this urn let those repair,renaissance
That are either true or fair;,renaissance
For these dead birds sigh a prayer.,renaissance
"Sing lullaby, as women do,",renaissance
"Wherewith they bring their babes to rest,",renaissance
And lullaby can I sing too,renaissance
As womanly as can the best.,renaissance
"With lullaby they still the child,",renaissance
"And if I be not much beguiled,",renaissance
Full many wanton babes have I,renaissance
Which must be stilled with lullaby.,renaissance
First lullaby my youthful years;,renaissance
"It is now time to go to bed,",renaissance
For crooked age and hoary hairs,renaissance
Have won the haven within my head.,renaissance
"With lullaby, then, youth be still;",renaissance
With lullaby content thy will;,renaissance
"Since courage quails and comes behind,",renaissance
"Go sleep, and so beguile thy mind.",renaissance
"Next, lullaby my gazing eyes,",renaissance
Which wonted were to glance apace.,renaissance
For every glass may now suffice,renaissance
To show the furrows in my face;,renaissance
"With lullaby then wink awhile,",renaissance
With lullaby your looks beguile;,renaissance
Let no fair face nor beauty bright,renaissance
Entice you eft with vain delight.,renaissance
"And lullaby, my wanton will;",renaissance
"Let reason's rule now reign thy thought,",renaissance
Since all too late I find by skill,renaissance
How dear I have thy fancies bought;,renaissance
"With lullaby now take thine ease,",renaissance
With lullaby thy doubts appease.,renaissance
"For trust to this: if thou be still,",renaissance
My body shall obey thy will.,renaissance
"Eke lullaby, my loving boy,",renaissance
"My little Robin, take thy rest;",renaissance
"Since age is cold and nothing coy,",renaissance
"Keep close thy coin, for so is best;",renaissance
"With lullaby be thou content,",renaissance
"With lullaby thy lusts relent,",renaissance
Let others pay which hath mo pence;,renaissance
Thou art too poor for such expense.,renaissance
"Thus lullaby, my youth, mine eyes,",renaissance
"My will, my ware, and all that was.",renaissance
"I can no mo delays devise,",renaissance
"But welcome pain, let pleasure pass;",renaissance
"With lullaby now take your leave,",renaissance
With lullaby your dreams deceive;,renaissance
"And when you rise with waking eye,",renaissance
Remember then this lullaby.,renaissance
Beshrew that heart that makes my heart to groan,renaissance
For that deep wound it gives my friend and me:,renaissance
"Ist not enough to torture me alone,",renaissance
But slave to slavery my sweetst friend must be?,renaissance
"Me from myself thy cruel eye hath taken,",renaissance
And my next self thou harder hast engrossed;,renaissance
"Of him, myself, and thee I am forsaken,",renaissance
A torment thrice threefold thus to be crossed.,renaissance
"Prison my heart in thy steel bosom's ward,",renaissance
But then my friend's heart let my poor heart bail;,renaissance
"Whoeer keeps me, let my heart be his guard:",renaissance
Thou canst not then use rigour in my jail.,renaissance
"And yet thou wilt; for I, being pent in thee,",renaissance
"Perforce am thine, and all that is in me.",renaissance
"O, call not me to justify the wrong",renaissance
That thy unkindness lays upon my heart;,renaissance
Wound me not with thine eye but with thy tongue;,renaissance
"Use power with power, and slay me not by art.",renaissance
"Tell me thou lovst elsewhere; but in my sight,",renaissance
"Dear heart, forbear to glance thine eye aside;",renaissance
What needst thou wound with cunning when thy might,renaissance
Is more than my oerpressed defense can bide?,renaissance
"Let me excuse thee: ah, my love well knows",renaissance
Her pretty looks have been mine enemies;,renaissance
"And therefore from my face she turns my foes,",renaissance
That they elsewhere might dart their injuries,renaissance
"Yet do not so; but since I am near slain,",renaissance
Kill me outright with looks and rid my pain.,renaissance
"Love is my sin, and thy dear virtue hate,",renaissance
"Hate of my sin, grounded on sinful loving.",renaissance
"O, but with mine compare thou thine own state,",renaissance
And thou shalt find it merits not reproving;,renaissance
"Or if it do, not from those lips of thine,",renaissance
That have profaned their scarlet ornaments,renaissance
"And sealed false bonds of love as oft as mine,",renaissance
Robbed others beds revenues of their rents.,renaissance
Be it lawful I love thee as thou lovst those,renaissance
Whom thine eyes woo as mine importune thee:,renaissance
"Root pity in thy heart, that, when it grows,",renaissance
Thy pity may deserve to pitied be.,renaissance
"If thou dost seek to have what thou dost hide,",renaissance
By self-example mayst thou be denied.,renaissance
"My love is as a fever, longing still",renaissance
"For that which longer nurseth the disease,",renaissance
"Feeding on that which doth preserve the ill,",renaissance
Th uncertain sickly appetite to please.,renaissance
"My reason, the physician to my love,",renaissance
"Angry that his prescriptions are not kept,",renaissance
"Hath left me, and I desperate now approve",renaissance
"Desire is death, which physic did except.",renaissance
"Past cure I am, now reason is past care,",renaissance
And frantic-mad with evermore unrest;,renaissance
"My thoughts and my discourse as madmens are,",renaissance
At random from the truth vainly expressed:,renaissance
"For I have sworn thee fair, and thought thee bright,",renaissance
"Who art as black as hell, as dark as night.",renaissance
"A Poet am I neither born nor bred,",renaissance
But to a witty poet married:,renaissance
"Whose brain is fresh and pleasant as the Spring,",renaissance
Where Fancies grow and where the Muses sing.,renaissance
"There oft I lean my head, and listening, hark,",renaissance
To catch his words and all his fancies mark:,renaissance
And from that garden show of beauties take,renaissance
Whereof a posy I in verse may make.,renaissance
"Thus I, that have no gardens of my own,",renaissance
There gather flowers that are newly blown.,renaissance
"Loving in truth, and fain in verse my love to show,",renaissance
"That she, dear she, might take some pleasure of my pain,",renaissance
"Pleasure might cause her read, reading might make her know,",renaissance
"Knowledge might pity win, and pity grace obtain,",renaissance
"I sought fit words to paint the blackest face of woe,",renaissance
"Studying inventions fine, her wits to entertain,",renaissance
"Oft turning others leaves, to see if thence would flow",renaissance
Some fresh and fruitful showers upon my sunburned brain.,renaissance
"But words came halting forth, wanting Inventions stay:",renaissance
"Invention, Natures child, fled step-dame Studys blows,",renaissance
And others feet still seemed but strangers in my way.,renaissance
"Thus great with child to speak, and helpless in my throes,",renaissance
"Biting my truant pen, beating myself for spite:",renaissance
"Fool, said my Muse to me, look in thy heart and write.",renaissance
"Misus and Mopsa hardly could agree,",renaissance
Striving about superiority.,renaissance
"The text which says that man and wife are one,",renaissance
Was the chief argument they stood upon. ,renaissance
"She held they both one woman should become,",renaissance
"He held both should be man, and both but one.",renaissance
"So they contended daily, but the strife",renaissance
"Could not be ended, till both were one wife.",renaissance
"Joy of my life, full oft for loving you",renaissance
"I bless my lot, that was so lucky placed:",renaissance
"But then the more your own mishap I rue,",renaissance
That are so much by so mean love embased.,renaissance
For had the equal heavens so much you graced,renaissance
"In this as in the rest, ye might invent",renaissance
"Some heavenly wit, whose verse could have enchased",renaissance

The reaped harvest of the light,renaissance

Those cherries fairly do enclose,renaissance
"   Of orient pearl a double row,",renaissance
"Which when her lovely laughter shows,",renaissance
   They look like rose-buds filled with snow;,renaissance
      Yet them no peer nor prince can buy,renaissance
      Till Cherry-ripe themselves do cry.,renaissance
Her eyes like angels watch them still;,renaissance
"   Her brows like bended bows do stand,",renaissance
Threat'ning with piercing frowns to kill,renaissance
   All that attempt with eye or hand,renaissance
"      Those sacred cherries to come nigh,",renaissance
      Till Cherry-ripe themselves do cry.,renaissance
"      The time is come, I must depart",renaissance
"   from thee, ah famous city;",renaissance
"I never yet to rue my smart,",renaissance
   did find that thou hadst pity.,renaissance

"Whether it best be more to mell,",renaissance
   or utterly defy.,renaissance
And now hath time me put in mind,renaissance
"   of thy great cruelness,",renaissance
"That never once a help would find,",renaissance
   to ease me in distress.,renaissance
Thou never yet wouldst credit give,renaissance
   to board me for a year;,renaissance
"Nor with apparel me relieve,",renaissance
   except thou payed were.,renaissance
"No, no, thou never didst me good,",renaissance

Whose absent flame did make me burn:,renaissance
"But when I find the lack, Lord, how I mourn!",renaissance
When other lovers in arms across,renaissance
Rejoice their chief delight.,renaissance
"Drowned in tears, to mourn my loss",renaissance
I stand the bitter night,renaissance
"In my window, where I may see",renaissance
Before the winds how the clouds flee.,renaissance
Lo! what a mariner love hath made of me!,renaissance
And in green waves when the salt flood,renaissance
"Doth rise by rage of wind,",renaissance
A thousand fancies in that mood,renaissance
Assail my restless mind.,renaissance
"Alas! now drencheth my sweet foe,",renaissance
"That with the spoil of my heart did go,",renaissance
"And left me; but, alas! why did he so?",renaissance
And when the seas wax calm again,renaissance
"To chase fro me annoy,",renaissance
My doubtful hope doth cause me pain;,renaissance
So dread cuts off my joy.,renaissance
"Thus is my wealth mingled with woe,",renaissance
And of each thought a doubt doth grow;,renaissance
"Now he comes! Will he come? Alas, no, no!",renaissance
 Unto the boundless Ocean of thy beauty,renaissance
"Runs this poor river, charged with streams of zeal:",renaissance
"Returning thee the tribute of my duty,",renaissance
"Which here my love, my youth, my plaints reveal.",renaissance
"Here I unclasp the book of my charged soul,",renaissance
Where I have cast th'accounts of all my care:,renaissance
"Here have I summed my sighs, here I enroll",renaissance
How they were spent for thee; look what they are.,renaissance
"Look on the dear expenses of my youth,",renaissance
And see how just I reckon with thine eyes:,renaissance
"Examine well thy beauty with my truth,",renaissance
And cross my cares ere greater sum arise.,renaissance
"Read it sweet maid, though it be done but slightly;",renaissance
"Who can show all his love, doth love but lightly.",renaissance

"Minerva-like, brought forth without a Mother:",renaissance
"Present the image of the cares I prove,",renaissance
Witness your Fathers grief exceeds all other.,renaissance
"Sigh out a story of her cruel deeds,",renaissance
With interrupted accents of despair:,renaissance
"A monument that whosoever reads,",renaissance
"May justly praise, and blame my loveless Fair.",renaissance
"Say her disdain hath dried up my blood,",renaissance
"And starved you, in succours still denying:",renaissance
"Press to her eyes, importune me some good;",renaissance
Waken her sleeping pity with your crying.,renaissance

When thou wilt close up that which now thou shewst;,renaissance
And think the same becomes they fading best,renaissance
Which then shall most inveil and shadow most.,renaissance
"Men do not weigh the stalk for what it was,",renaissance
"When once they find her flower, her glory, pass.",renaissance

When Winter snows upon thy golden hairs.,renaissance
"Unhappy pen and ill accepted papers,",renaissance
"That intimate in vain my chaste desires,",renaissance
"My chaste desires, the ever burning tapers,",renaissance
Enkindled by her eyes celestial fires.,renaissance
"Celestial fires and unrespecting powers,",renaissance

"In humble lines the work of careful hours,",renaissance
The sacrifice I offer to her sight.,renaissance
"But since she scorns her own, this rests for me,",renaissance
"Ill moan my self, and hide the wrong I have:",renaissance
And so content me that her frowns should be,renaissance
"To my infant style the cradle, and the grave.",renaissance
"What though my self no honor get thereby,",renaissance
"Each bird sings therself, and so will I.",renaissance
A face that should content me wondrous well,renaissance
"Should not be fair but lovely to behold,",renaissance
With gladsome cheer all grief for to expel;,renaissance
With sober looks so would I that it should,renaissance
Speak without words such words as none can tell;,renaissance
Her tress also should be of crisped gold;,renaissance
"With wit; and thus might chance I might be tied,",renaissance
And knit again the knot that should not slide.,renaissance
In summers heat and mid-time of the day,renaissance
"To rest my limbs upon a bed I lay,",renaissance
"One window shut, the other open stood,",renaissance
"Which gave such light as twinkles in a wood,",renaissance
Like twilight glimpse at setting of the sun,renaissance

Swelling on either side to want his bliss;,renaissance

As the grim lion fawneth oer his prey,renaissance
"Sharp hunger by the conquest satisfied,",renaissance

"Whose ranks of blue veins, as his hand did scale,",renaissance
Left their round turrets destitute and pale.,renaissance
"They, mustering to the quiet cabinet",renaissance
"Where their dear governess and lady lies,",renaissance
Do tell her she is dreadfully beset,renaissance
And fright her with confusion of their cries.,renaissance

Are by his flaming torch dimmed and controlled.,renaissance
Imagine her as one in dead of night,renaissance

Now with his feet.,renaissance

His bed amidst my tender breast;,renaissance

The livelong night.,renaissance
"Strike I my lute, he tunes the string;",renaissance
He music plays if so I sing;,renaissance
He lends me every lovely thing;,renaissance
Yet cruel he my heart doth sting.,renaissance
"Whist, wanton, still ye!",renaissance
Else I with roses every day,renaissance
"Will whip you hence,",renaissance

"Sing no more ditties, sing no more",renaissance
    Of dumps so dull and heavy.,renaissance
The fraud of men was ever so,renaissance
    Since summer first was leafy.,renaissance

Tis with us perpetual night.,renaissance
Why should we defer our joys?,renaissance
Fame and rumor are but toys.,renaissance
Cannot we delude the eyes,renaissance
"Of a few poor household spies,",renaissance
"Or his easier ears beguile,",renaissance
So removed by our wile?,renaissance
Tis no sin loves fruit to steal;,renaissance
"But the sweet thefts to reveal,",renaissance
"To be taken, to be seen,",renaissance
"These have crimes accounted been.Who is Silvia? what is she,",renaissance
    That all our swains commend her?,renaissance
"Holy, fair, and wise is she;",renaissance
"    The heaven such grace did lend her,",renaissance
That she might admired be.,renaissance
Is she kind as she is fair?,renaissance
    For beauty lives with kindness.,renaissance
"Love doth to her eyes repair,",renaissance
    To help him of his blindness;,renaissance
"And, being helped, inhabits there.",renaissance
"Then to Silvia let us sing,",renaissance
    That Silvia is excelling;,renaissance
She excels each mortal thing,renaissance
    Upon the dull earth dwelling;,renaissance
"To her let us garlands bringFrom fairest creatures we desire increase,",renaissance
"That thereby beautys rose might never die,",renaissance
"But as the riper should by time decease,",renaissance
His tender heir might bear his memory;,renaissance
"But thou, contracted to thine own bright eyes,",renaissance
"Feedst thy lights flame with self-substantial fuel,",renaissance
"Making a famine where abundance lies,",renaissance
"Thyself thy foe, to thy sweet self too cruel.",renaissance
Though that art now the worlds fresh ornament,renaissance

   When forty winters shall besiege thy brow,renaissance
"And dig deep trenches in thy beautys field,",renaissance
"Thy youths proud livery, so gazed on now,",renaissance
"Will be a tattered weed, of small worth held.",renaissance
Then being asked where all thy beauty lies,renaissance
Where all the treasure of thy lusty days,renaissance
To say within thine own deep-sunken eyes,renaissance
Were an all-eating shame and thriftless praise.,renaissance
How much more praise deserved thy beautys use ,renaissance
"If thou couldst answer ""This fair child of mine",renaissance
"Shall sum my count and make my old excuse"", ",renaissance
Proving his beauty by succession thine.,renaissance

"Now is the time that face should form another,",renaissance
"Whose fresh repair if now thou not renewest,",renaissance
"Thou dost beguile the world, unbless some mother.",renaissance

"Thou art thy mothers glass, and she in thee",renaissance
Calls back the lovely April of her prime;,renaissance
"So thou through windows of thine age shalt see,",renaissance

    Shall I compare thee to a summers day?,renaissance
Thou art more lovely and more temperate:,renaissance

And often is his gold complexion dimm'd;,renaissance
"And every fair from fair sometime declines,",renaissance
By chance or natures changing course untrimm'd;,renaissance
"But thy eternal summer shall not fade,",renaissance
Nor lose possession of that fair thou owst;,renaissance
"Nor shall death brag thou wanderst in his shade,",renaissance
When in eternal lines to time thou growst:,renaissance
"   So long as men can breathe or eyes can see,",renaissance
"   So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.",renaissance
   A womans face with natures own hand painted,renaissance
"Hast thou, the master-mistress of my passion;",renaissance
"A womans gentle heart, but not acquainted",renaissance
With shifting change as is false womens fashion;,renaissance
"An eye more bright than theirs, less false in rolling,",renaissance
Gilding the object whereupon it gazeth;,renaissance
"A man in hue, all hues in his controlling,",renaissance
Which steals mens eyes and womens souls amazeth.,renaissance
"And for a woman wert thou first created,",renaissance
"Till nature as she wrought thee fell a-doting,",renaissance
And by addition me of thee defeated,renaissance
By adding one thing to my purpose nothing.,renaissance
"      But since she pricked thee out for women's pleasure,",renaissance
      Mine be thy love and thy loves use their treasure.,renaissance
      No more be grieved at that which thou hast done:,renaissance
"Roses have thorns, and silver fountains mud,",renaissance
"Clouds and eclipses stain both moon and sun,",renaissance
And loathsome canker lives in sweetest bud.,renaissance
"All men make faults, and even I in this,",renaissance
"Authorizing thy trespass with compare,",renaissance
"Myself corrupting salving thy amiss,",renaissance
Excusing thy sins more than thy sins are:,renaissance
For to thy sensual fault I bring in sense,renaissance
Thy adverse party is thy advocate,renaissance
And gainst myself a lawful plea commence.,renaissance
"Such civil war is in my love and hate,",renaissance
   That I an accessory needs must be,renaissance
   To that sweet thief which sourly robs from me.,renaissance
"   Take all my loves, my love, yea, take them all:",renaissance
What hast thou then more than thou hadst before?,renaissance
"No love, my love, that thou mayst true love call",renaissance
All mine was thine before thou hadst this more.,renaissance
"Then if for my love thou my love receivest,",renaissance
I cannot blame thee for my love thou usest;,renaissance
But yet be blamed if thou this self deceivest,renaissance
By wilful taste of what thyself refusest.,renaissance
"I do forgive thy robbry, gentle thief,",renaissance
Although thou steal thee all my poverty;,renaissance
And yet love knows it is a greater grief,renaissance
To bear loves wrong than hates known injury.,renaissance
"    Lascivious grace, in whom all ill well shows,",renaissance
"    Kill me with spites, yet we must not be foes.",renaissance
    Not marble nor the gilded monuments,renaissance
"Of princes shall outlive this powerful rhyme,",renaissance
But you shall shine more bright in these contents,renaissance
Than unswept stone besmeared with sluttish time.,renaissance
"When wasteful war shall statues overturn,",renaissance
"And broils root out the work of masonry,",renaissance
Nor Mars his sword nor wars quick fire shall burn,renaissance
The living record of your memory.,renaissance
Gainst death and all-oblivious enmity,renaissance
Shall you pace forth; your praise shall still find room,renaissance
Even in the eyes of all posterity,renaissance
That wear this world out to the ending doom.,renaissance
"    So, till the Judgement that yourself arise,",renaissance

Upon the hours and times of your desire?,renaissance
"I have no precious time at all to spend,",renaissance
"Nor services to do, till you require.",renaissance
Nor dare I chide the world-without-end hour,renaissance
"Whilst I, my sovereign, watch the clock for you.",renaissance
Nor think the bitterness of absence sour,renaissance
When you have bid your servant once adieu;,renaissance
Nor dare I question with my jealous thought,renaissance
"Where you may be, or your affairs suppose,",renaissance
"But like a sad slave, stay and think of nought,",renaissance
"Save, where you are how happy you make those.",renaissance
So true a fool is love that in your will,renaissance
"Though you do anything, he thinks no ill.",renaissance

Whose action is no stronger than a flower?,renaissance
"O, how shall summers honey breath hold out",renaissance
"Against the wrackful siege of battring days,",renaissance
"When rocks impregnable are not so stout,",renaissance
"Nor gates of steel so strong, but time decays?",renaissance
"O fearful meditation! where, alack,",renaissance
Shall times best jewel from times chest lie hid?,renaissance
Or what strong hand can hold his swift foot back?,renaissance
Or who his spoil of beauty can forbid?,renaissance
"   O, none, unless this miracle have might,",renaissance
   That in black ink my love may still shine bright.,renaissance
"   Why is my verse so barren of new pride,",renaissance
So far from variation or quick change?,renaissance
Why with the time do I not glance aside,renaissance
"To new-found methods, and to compounds strange?",renaissance
"Why write I still all one, ever the same,",renaissance
"And keep invention in a noted weed,",renaissance
"That every word doth almost tell my name,",renaissance
"Showing their birth, and where they did proceed?",renaissance
"O know, sweet love, I always write of you,",renaissance
"And you and love are still my argument,",renaissance
"So all my best is dressing old words new,",renaissance
Spending again what is already spent:,renaissance
"   For as the sun is daily new and old,",renaissance
   So is my love still telling what is told.,renaissance
"   Farewell! thou art too dear for my possessing,",renaissance
And like enough thou knowst thy estimate.,renaissance
The Charter of thy worth gives thee releasing;,renaissance
My bonds in thee are all determinate.,renaissance
"For how do I hold thee but by thy granting,",renaissance
And for that riches where is my deserving?,renaissance
"The cause of this fair gift in me is wanting,",renaissance
And so my patent back again is swerving.,renaissance
"Thy self thou gav'st, thy own worth then not knowing,",renaissance
"Or me, to whom thou gav'st it, else mistaking,",renaissance
"So thy great gift, upon misprision growing,",renaissance
"Comes home again, on better judgement making.",renaissance
   Thus have I had thee as a dream doth flatter:,renaissance
"   In sleep a king, but waking no such matter.",renaissance
"   From you have I been absent in the spring,",renaissance
"When proud-pied April, dressed in all his trim,",renaissance
"Hath put a spirit of youth in everything,",renaissance
That heavy Saturn laughed and leaped with him.,renaissance
"Yet nor the lays of birds, nor the sweet smell",renaissance
"Of different flowers in odour and in hue,",renaissance
"Could make me any summers story tell,",renaissance
Or from their proud lap pluck them where they grew:,renaissance
"Nor did I wonder at the lilys white,",renaissance
Nor praise the deep vermilion in the rose;,renaissance
"They were but sweet, but figures of delight",renaissance
"Drawn after you,  you pattern of all those.",renaissance
"    Yet seemd it winter still, and, you away,",renaissance
    As with your shadow I with these did play.,renaissance
"    To me, fair friend, you never can be old,",renaissance
"For as you were when first your eye I eyed,",renaissance
Such seems your beauty still. Three winters cold,renaissance
"Have from the forests shook three summers pride,",renaissance
Three beauteous springs to yellow autumn turned,renaissance
"In process of the seasons have I seen,",renaissance
"Three April perfumes in three hot Junes burned,",renaissance
"Since first I saw you fresh, which yet are green.",renaissance
"Ah, yet doth beauty, like a dial-hand,",renaissance
"Steal from his figure, and no pace perceived;",renaissance
"So your sweet hue, which methinks still doth stand,",renaissance
"Hath motion, and mine eye may be deceived:",renaissance
"For fear of which, hear this, thou age unbred:",renaissance
Ere you were born was beautys summer dead.,renaissance
"O! never say that I was false of heart,",renaissance
Though absence seemed my flame to qualify.,renaissance
As easy might I from myself depart,renaissance
"As from my soul, which in thy breast doth lie:",renaissance
"That is my home of love; if I have ranged,",renaissance
"Like him that travels, I return again,",renaissance
"Just to the time, not with the time exchanged,",renaissance
So that myself bring water for my stain.,renaissance
"Never believe, though in my nature reigned",renaissance
"All frailties that besiege all kinds of blood,",renaissance
"That it could so preposterously be stained,",renaissance
To leave for nothing all thy sum of good;,renaissance
"   For nothing this wide universe I call,",renaissance
"   Save thou, my rose; in it thou art my all.",renaissance
"   O thou, my lovely boy, who in thy powr",renaissance
"Dost hold times fickle glass his sickle hour,",renaissance

"Thy lovers withering, as thy sweet self growst",renaissance
"In nature, sovereign mistress over wrack,",renaissance
"As thou goest onwards still will pluck thee back,",renaissance
"She keeps thee to this purpose, that her skill",renaissance
"May time disgrace, and wretched minute kill.",renaissance
"Yet fear her, O thou minion of her pleasure;",renaissance
She may detain but not still keep her treasure.,renaissance
"   Her audit, though delayed, answered must be,",renaissance
   And her quietus is to render thee.,renaissance
"   Whoever hath her wish, thou hast thy Will,",renaissance
"And Will to boot, and Will in overplus;",renaissance
"More than enough am I that vex thee still,",renaissance
To thy sweet will making addition thus.,renaissance
"Wilt thou, whose will is large and spacious,",renaissance
Not once vouchsafe to hide my will in thine?,renaissance
"Shall will in others seem right gracious,",renaissance
And in my will no fair acceptance shine?,renaissance
"The sea, all water, yet receives rain still,",renaissance
And in abundance addeth to his store;,renaissance
So thou being rich in Will add to thy Will,renaissance
"One will of mine, to make thy large Will more.",renaissance
"   Let no unkind, no fair beseechers kill;",renaissance
"   Think all but one, and me in that one Will.",renaissance
"   When my love swears that she is made of truth,",renaissance
"I do believe her, though I know she lies,",renaissance
"That she might think me some untutored youth,",renaissance
Unlearned in the worlds false subtleties.,renaissance
"Thus vainly thinking that she thinks me young,",renaissance
"Although she knows my days are past the best,",renaissance
Simply I credit her false-speaking tongue:,renaissance
On both sides thus is simple truth suppressed.,renaissance
But wherefore says she not she is unjust?,renaissance
And wherefore say not I that I am old?,renaissance
"Oh, loves best habit is in seeming trust,",renaissance
And age in love loves not to have years told.,renaissance
"    Therefore I lie with her and she with me,",renaissance
    And in our faults by lies we flattered be.,renaissance
"    In faith, I do not love thee with mine eyes,",renaissance
For they in thee a thousand errors note;,renaissance
"But tis my heart that loves what they despise,",renaissance
"Who, in despite of view, is pleased to dote;",renaissance
"Nor are mine ears with thy tongues tune delighted,",renaissance
"Nor tender feeling, to base touches prone,",renaissance
"Nor taste, nor smell, desire to be invited",renaissance
To any sensual feast with thee alone:,renaissance
But my five wits nor my five senses can,renaissance
"Dissuade one foolish heart from serving thee,",renaissance
"Who leaves unswayed the likeness of a man,",renaissance
Thy proud hearts slave and vassal wretch to be.,renaissance
"   Only my plague thus far I count my gain,",renaissance
   That she that makes me sin awards me pain.,renaissance
"   Two loves I have of comfort and despair,",renaissance
Which like two spirits do suggest me still,renaissance
"The better angel is a man right fair,",renaissance
The worser spirit a woman coloured ill.,renaissance
"To win me soon to hell, my female evil",renaissance
"Tempteth my better angel from my side,",renaissance
"And would corrupt my saint to be a devil,",renaissance
Wooing his purity with her foul pride.,renaissance
"And, whether that my angel be turnd fiend,",renaissance
"Suspect I may, yet not directly tell,",renaissance
"But being both from me both to each friend,",renaissance
I guess one angel in anothers hell.,renaissance
"   Yet this shall I neer know, but live in doubt,",renaissance
   Till my bad angel fire my good one out.,renaissance
"   I that have been a lover, and could show it,",renaissance
"Though not in these, in rithmes not wholly dumb,",renaissance
"Since I exscribe your sonnets, am become",renaissance
"A better lover, and much better poet.",renaissance
Nor is my Muse or I ashamed to owe it,renaissance
"To those true numerous graces, whereof some",renaissance
"But charm the senses, others overcome",renaissance
Both brains and hearts; and mine now best do know it:,renaissance
"For in your verse all Cupids armory,",renaissance
"His flames, his shafts, his quiver, and his bow,",renaissance
His very eyes are yours to overthrow.,renaissance
"But then his mothers sweets you so apply,",renaissance
"Her joys, her smiles, her loves, as readers take",renaissance
For Venus ceston every line you make.,renaissance
"Take, oh, take those lips away",renaissance
That so sweetly were forsworn,renaissance
"And those eyes, like break of day,",renaissance
Lights that do mislead the morn;,renaissance
"But my kisses bring again,",renaissance
"Seals of love, though sealed in vain.",renaissance
"Hide, oh, hide those hills of snow,",renaissance
"Which thy frozen bosom bears,",renaissance
On whose tops the pinks that grow,renaissance
Are of those that April wears;,renaissance
"But first set my poor heart free,",renaissance
Bound in those icy chains by thee.,renaissance
"Though I am young, and cannot tell",renaissance
"    Either what Death or Love is well,",renaissance
"Yet I have heard they both bear darts,",renaissance
    And both do aim at human hearts.,renaissance
"And then again, I have been told",renaissance
"    Love wounds with heat, as Death with cold;",renaissance
So that I fear they do but bring,renaissance
"    Extremes to touch, and mean one thing.",renaissance
As in a ruin we it call,renaissance
"    One thing to be blown up, or fall;",renaissance
Or to our end like way may have,renaissance
"    By a flash of lightning, or a wave;",renaissance
So Loves inflamed shaft or brand,renaissance
    May kill as soon as Deaths cold hand;,renaissance
Except Loves fires the virtue have,renaissance
    To fright the frost out of the grave.,renaissance
"    Though that men do call it dotage,",renaissance
Who loveth not wanteth courage;,renaissance
"And whosoever may love get,",renaissance
From Venus sure he must it fet,renaissance
"Or else from her which is her heir,",renaissance
And she to him must seem most fair.,renaissance
With eye and mind doth both agree.,renaissance
There is no boot: there must it be.,renaissance
"The eye doth look and represent,",renaissance
But mind afformeth with full consent.,renaissance
Thus am I fixed without grudge:,renaissance
Mine eye with heart doth me so judge.,renaissance
Love maintaineth all noble courage.,renaissance
Who love disdaineth is all of the village:,renaissance
Such loversthough they take pain,renaissance
"It were pity they should obtain,",renaissance
For often times where they do sue,renaissance
They hinder lovers that would be true.,renaissance
For whoso loveth should love but once.,renaissance
"Change whoso will, I will be none.",renaissance
"Come, Madam, come, all rest my powers defy,",renaissance
"Until I labour, I in labour lie.",renaissance
"The foe oft-times having the foe in sight,",renaissance
Is tird with standing though he never fight.,renaissance
"Off with that girdle, like heavens Zone glistering,",renaissance
But a far fairer world encompassing.,renaissance
"Unpin that spangled breastplate which you wear,",renaissance
That theyes of busy fools may be stopped there.,renaissance
"Unlace yourself, for that harmonious chime,",renaissance
"Tells me from you, that now it is bed time.",renaissance
"Off with that happy busk, which I envy,",renaissance
"That still can be, and still can stand so nigh.",renaissance
"Your gown going off, such beauteous state reveals,",renaissance
As when from flowery meads thhills shadow steals.,renaissance
Off with that wiry Coronet and shew,renaissance
The hairy Diadem which on you doth grow:,renaissance
"Now off with those shoes, and then safely tread",renaissance
"In this loves hallowd temple, this soft bed.",renaissance
"In such white robes, heavens Angels used to be",renaissance
Received by men; Thou Angel bringst with thee,renaissance
A heaven like Mahomets Paradise; and though,renaissance
"Ill spirits walk in white, we easily know,",renaissance
"By this these Angels from an evil sprite,",renaissance
"Those set our hairs, but these our flesh upright.",renaissance
"    Licence my roving hands, and let them go,",renaissance
"Before, behind, between, above, below.",renaissance
"O my America! my new-found-land,",renaissance
"My kingdom, safeliest when with one man mannd,",renaissance
"My Mine of precious stones, My Empirie,",renaissance
How blest am I in this discovering thee!,renaissance
"To enter in these bonds, is to be free;",renaissance
"Then where my hand is set, my seal shall be.",renaissance
"    Full nakedness! All joys are due to thee,",renaissance
"As souls unbodied, bodies unclothd must be,",renaissance
To taste whole joys. Gems which you women use,renaissance
"Are like Atlantas balls, cast in mens views,",renaissance
"That when a fools eye lighteth on a Gem,",renaissance
"His earthly soul may covet theirs, not them.",renaissance
"Like pictures, or like books gay coverings made",renaissance
"For lay-men, are all women thus arrayd;",renaissance
"Themselves are mystic books, which only we",renaissance
(Whom their imputed grace will dignify),renaissance
Must see reveald. Then since that I may know;,renaissance

"Thy self: cast all, yea, this white linen hence,",renaissance
There is no penance due to innocence.,renaissance
"    To teach thee, I am naked first; why then",renaissance
What needst thou have more covering than a man.,renaissance
"Merry Margaret,",renaissance
"As midsummer flower,",renaissance
Gentle as a falcon,renaissance
Or hawk of the tower:,renaissance
"With solace and gladness,",renaissance
"Much mirth and no madness,",renaissance
All good and no badness;,renaissance
"So joyously,",renaissance
"So maidenly,",renaissance
So womanly,renaissance
Her demeaning,renaissance
"In every thing,",renaissance
"Far, far passing",renaissance
"That I can indite,",renaissance
Or suffice to write,renaissance
Of Merry Margaret,renaissance
"As midsummer flower,",renaissance
Gentle as falcon,renaissance
Or hawk of the tower.,renaissance
As patient and still,renaissance
And as full of good will,renaissance
"As fair Isaphill,",renaissance
"Coriander,",renaissance
"Sweet pomander,",renaissance
"Good Cassander,",renaissance
"Steadfast of thought,",renaissance
"Well made, well wrought,",renaissance
Far may be sought,renaissance
Ere that ye can find,renaissance
"So courteous, so kind",renaissance
"As Merry Margaret,",renaissance
"This midsummer flower,",renaissance
Gentle as falcon,renaissance
Or hawk of the tower.,renaissance
That neither fame nor love might wanting be,renaissance

"Whose house, if it no other honor had,",renaissance
In only thee might be both great and glad;,renaissance
"Who, to upbraid the sloth of this our time,",renaissance
"Durst valor make almost, but not, a crime;",renaissance
"Which deed I know not, whether were more high,",renaissance
"Or thou more happy, it to justify",renaissance
"Against thy fortune: when no foe, that day,",renaissance
"Could conquer thee but chance, who did betray.",renaissance
"Love thy great loss, which a renown hath won,",renaissance
"To live when Broick not stands, nor Ruhr doth run.",renaissance
"Love honors, which of best example be",renaissance
When they cost dearest and are done most free;,renaissance
"Though every fortitude deserves applause,",renaissance
It may be much or little in the cause.,renaissance
"Hes valiantst that dares fight, and not for pay;",renaissance
"That virtuous is, when the rewards away.",renaissance
"Methought I saw the grave where Laura lay,",renaissance
Within that temple where the vestal flame,renaissance
"Was wont to burn; and, passing by that way,",renaissance
"To see that buried dust of living fame,",renaissance
"Whose tomb fair Love, and fairer Virtue kept:",renaissance
All suddenly I saw the Fairy Queen;,renaissance
"At whose approach the soul of Petrarch wept,",renaissance
"And, from thenceforth, those Graces were not seen:",renaissance
For they this queen attended; in whose stead,renaissance
Oblivion laid him down on Lauras hearse:,renaissance
"Hereat the hardest stones were seen to bleed,",renaissance
And groans of buried ghosts the heavens did pierce:,renaissance
"Where Homers spright did tremble all for grief,",renaissance
And cursed the access of that celestial thief!,renaissance
"When thou must home to shades of underground,",renaissance
"And there arrived, a new admired guest,",renaissance
"The beauteous spirits do engirt thee round,",renaissance
"White Iope, blithe Helen, and the rest,",renaissance
To hear the stories of thy finished love,renaissance
From that smooth tongue whose music hell can move;,renaissance
"Then wilt thou speak of banqueting delights,",renaissance
"Of masques and revels which sweet youth did make,",renaissance
"Of tourneys and great challenges of knights,",renaissance
And all these triumphs for thy beautys sake:,renaissance
"When thou hast told these honours done to thee,",renaissance
"Then tell, O tell, how thou didst murder me!",renaissance
As you came from the holy land,renaissance
of Walsinghame,renaissance
Met you not with my true love,renaissance
By the way as you came?,renaissance
How shall I know your true love,renaissance
That have met many one,renaissance
As I went to the holy land,renaissance
"That have come, that have gone?",renaissance
She is neither white nor brown,renaissance
But as the heavens fair,renaissance
There is none hath a form so divine,renaissance
In the earth or the air.,renaissance
"Such an one did I meet, good Sir,",renaissance
"Such an Angelic face,",renaissance
"Who like a queen, like a nymph, did appear",renaissance
"By her gait, by her grace.",renaissance
"She hath left me here all alone,",renaissance
"All alone as unknown,",renaissance
"Who sometimes did me lead with her self,",renaissance
And me loved as her own.,renaissance
Whats the cause that she leaves you alone,renaissance
And a new way doth take;,renaissance
Who loved you once as her own,renaissance
And her joy did you make?,renaissance
"I have loved her all my youth,",renaissance
"But now old, as you see,",renaissance
Love likes not the falling fruit,renaissance
From the withered tree.,renaissance
Know that love is a careless child,renaissance
"And forgets promise past,",renaissance
"He is blind, he is deaf when he list",renaissance
And in faith never fast.,renaissance
His desire is a dureless content,renaissance
And a trustless joy,renaissance
He is won with a world of despair,renaissance
And is lost with a toy.,renaissance
Of womenkind such indeed is the love,renaissance
Or the word Love abused,renaissance
Under which many childish desires,renaissance
And conceits are excused.,renaissance
But true Love is a durable fire,renaissance
In the mind ever burning;,renaissance
"Never sick, never old, never dead,",renaissance
From itself never turning.,renaissance
"What length of verse can serve brave Mopsas good to show,",renaissance
"Whose virtues strange, and beauties such, as no man them may know?",renaissance
"Thus shrewdly burden, then, how can my Muse escape?",renaissance
"The gods must help, and precious things must serve to show her shape.",renaissance
"Like great god Saturn, fair, and like fair Venus, chaste;",renaissance
"As smooth as Pan, as Juno mild, like goddess Iris fast.",renaissance
"With Cupid she foresees, and goes god Vulcans pace;",renaissance
"And for a taste of all these gifts, she borrows Momus grace.",renaissance
"Her forehead jacinth-like, her cheeks of opal hue,",renaissance
"Her twinkling eyes bedecked with pearl, her lips of sapphire blue,",renaissance
"Her hair pure crapall stone, her mouth, O heavenly wide,",renaissance
"Her skin like burnished gold, her hands like silver ore untried.",renaissance
"As for those parts unknown, which hidden sure are best,",renaissance
"Happy be they which believe, and never seek the rest.",renaissance
"When I was fair and young, then favor graced me.",renaissance
Of many was I sought their mistress for to be.,renaissance
But I did scorn them all and answered them therefore:,renaissance
"Go, go, go, seek some other where; importune me no more.",renaissance
"How many weeping eyes I made to pine in woe,",renaissance
"How many sighing hearts I have not skill to show,",renaissance
But I the prouder grew and still this spake therefore:,renaissance
"Go, go, go, seek some other where, importune me no more.",renaissance
"Then spake fair Venus son, that proud victorious boy,",renaissance
"Saying: You dainty dame, for that you be so coy,",renaissance
I will so pluck your plumes as you shall say no more:,renaissance
"Go, go, go, seek some other where, importune me no more.",renaissance
"As soon as he had said, such change grew in my breast",renaissance
That neither night nor day I could take any rest.,renaissance
Wherefore I did repent that I had said before:,renaissance
"Go, go, go, seek some other where, importune me no more.",renaissance
"When to her lute Corinna sings,",renaissance
"Her voice revives the leaden strings,",renaissance
And doth in highest notes appear,renaissance
As any challenged echo clear;,renaissance
"But when she doth of mourning speak,",renaissance
Evn with her sighs the strings do break.,renaissance
"And as her lute doth live or die,",renaissance
"Let by her passion, so must I:",renaissance
"For when of pleasure she doth sing,",renaissance
"My thoughts enjoy a sudden spring,",renaissance
"But if she doth of sorrow speak,",renaissance
Evn from my heart the strings do break.,renaissance
"Now thou has loved me one whole day,",renaissance
"Tomorrow when you leavst, what wilt thou say?",renaissance
Wilt thou then antedate some new-made vow?,renaissance
            Or say that now,renaissance
We are not just those persons which we were?,renaissance
"Or, that oaths made in reverential fear",renaissance
"Of Love, and his wrath, any may forswear?",renaissance
"Or, as true deaths true marriages untie,",renaissance
"So lovers contracts, images of those,",renaissance
"Bind but till sleep, deaths image, them unloose?",renaissance
"            Or, your own end to justify,",renaissance
"For having purposed change and falsehood, you",renaissance
Can have no way but falsehood to be true?,renaissance
"Vain lunatic, against these scapes I could",renaissance
"            Dispute and conquer, if I would,",renaissance
"            Which I abstain to do,",renaissance
"For by tomorrow, I may think so too.",renaissance
"Womanhood, wanton, ye want:",renaissance
"Your meddling, mistress, is mannerless;",renaissance
"Plenty of ill, of goodness scant,",renaissance
"Ye rail at riot, reckless:",renaissance
To praise your port it is needless;,renaissance
"For all your draff yet and your dregs,",renaissance
As well borne as ye full oft time begs.,renaissance
Why so coy and full of scorn?,renaissance
"Mine horse is sold, I ween, you say;",renaissance
"My new furred gown, when it is worn...",renaissance
"Put up your purse, ye shall not pay!",renaissance
"By crede, I trust to see the day,",renaissance
"As proud a pea-hen as ye spread,",renaissance
Of me and other ye may have need!,renaissance
"Though angelic be your smiling,",renaissance
"Yet is your tongue an adders tail,",renaissance
Full like a scorpion stinging,renaissance
All those by whom ye have avail.,renaissance
"Good mistress Anne, there ye do shail:",renaissance
"What prate ye, pretty pigesnye?",renaissance
I trust to quite you ere I die!,renaissance
"Your key is meet for every lock,",renaissance
Your key is common and hangeth out;,renaissance
"Your key is ready, we need not knock,",renaissance
Nor stand long wresting there about;,renaissance
Of your door-gate ye have no doubt:,renaissance
"But one thing is, that ye be lewd:",renaissance
"Hold your tongue now, all beshrewd!",renaissance
"To mistress Anne, that farly sweet,",renaissance
That wones at The Key in Thames Street.,renaissance
" Wyatt resteth here, that quick could never rest;",renaissance
"Whose heavenly gifts increased by disdain,",renaissance
And virtue sank the deeper in his breast;,renaissance
Such profit he of envy could obtain.,renaissance
"A head, where wisdom mysteries did frame,",renaissance
Whose hammers beat still in that lively brain,renaissance
"As on a stith, where some work of fame",renaissance
"Was daily wrought, to turn to Britains gain.",renaissance
"A visage, stern and mild; where both did grow,",renaissance
"Vice to condemn, in virtues to rejoice;",renaissance
"Amid great storms whom grace assured so,",renaissance
To live upright and smile at fortunes choice.,renaissance
A hand that taught what might be said in rhyme;,renaissance
That reft Chaucer the glory of his wit;,renaissance
"A mark the which (unperfited, for time)",renaissance
"Some may approach, but never none shall hit.",renaissance
A tongue that served in foreign realms his king;,renaissance
Whose courteous talk to virtue did enflame,renaissance
Each noble heart; a worthy guide to bring,renaissance
"Our English youth, by travail unto fame.",renaissance
"An eye whose judgment no affect could blind,",renaissance
"Friends to allure, and foes to reconcile;",renaissance
Whose piercing look did represent a mind,renaissance
"With virtue fraught, reposed, void of guile.",renaissance
A heart where dread yet never so impressed,renaissance
To hide the thought that might the truth avaunce;,renaissance
"In neither fortune lift, nor so repressed,",renaissance
"To swell in wealth, nor yield unto mischance.",renaissance
"A valiant corps, where force and beauty met,",renaissance
"Happy, alas! too happy, but for foes,",renaissance
"Lived, and ran the race that nature set;",renaissance
"Of manhoods shape, where she the mold did lose.",renaissance
"But to the heavens that simple soul is fled,",renaissance
"Which left with such, as covet Christ to know",renaissance
Witness of faith that never shall be dead:,renaissance
"Sent for our health, but not received so.",renaissance
"Thus, for our guilt, this jewel have we lost;",renaissance
"The earth his bones, the heavens possess his ghost.",renaissance
"Amen.Twice or thrice had I lov'd thee,",renaissance
Before I knew thy face or name;,renaissance
"So in a voice, so in a shapeless flame",renaissance
"Angels affect us oft, and worshipp'd be;",renaissance
"         Still when, to where thou wert, I came,",renaissance
Some lovely glorious nothing I did see.,renaissance
"         But since my soul, whose child love is,",renaissance
"Takes limbs of flesh, and else could nothing do,",renaissance
         More subtle than the parent is,renaissance
"Love must not be, but take a body too;",renaissance
"         And therefore what thou wert, and who,",renaissance
"                I bid Love ask, and now",renaissance
"That it assume thy body, I allow,",renaissance
"And fix itself in thy lip, eye, and brow.",renaissance
"Whilst thus to ballast love I thought,",renaissance
"And so more steadily to have gone,",renaissance
"With wares which would sink admiration,",renaissance
I saw I had love's pinnace overfraught;,renaissance
         Ev'ry thy hair for love to work upon,renaissance
"Is much too much, some fitter must be sought;",renaissance
"         For, nor in nothing, nor in things",renaissance
"Extreme, and scatt'ring bright, can love inhere;",renaissance
"         Then, as an angel, face, and wings",renaissance
"Of air, not pure as it, yet pure, doth wear,",renaissance
         So thy love may be my love's sphere;,renaissance
                Just such disparity,renaissance
"As is 'twixt air and angels' purity,",renaissance
"'Twixt women's love, and men's, will ever be.",renaissance
"Alas, madam, for stealing of a kiss",renaissance
Have I so much your mind there offended?,renaissance
Have I then done so grievously amiss,renaissance
That by no means it may be amended?,renaissance
"Then revenge you, and the next way is this:",renaissance
"Another kiss shall have my life ended,",renaissance
For to my mouth the first my heart did suck;,renaissance
The next shall clean out of my breast it pluck.,renaissance
"The sovereign beauty which I do admire,",renaissance
Witness the world how worthy to be praised:,renaissance
The light whereof hath kindled heavenly fire,renaissance
"In my frail spirit, by her from baseness raised;",renaissance
"That being now with her huge brightness dazed,",renaissance
Base thing I can no more endure to view;,renaissance
"But looking still on her, I stand amazed",renaissance
At wondrous sight of so celestial hue.,renaissance
"So when my tongue would speak her praises due,",renaissance
It stopped is with thought's astonishment:,renaissance
"And when my pen would write her titles true,",renaissance
It ravish'd is with fancy's wonderment:,renaissance
Yet in my heart I then both speak and write,renaissance
The wonder that my wit cannot endite.,renaissance
"ike as a huntsman after weary chase,",renaissance
"Seeing the game from him escap'd away,",renaissance
"Sits down to rest him in some shady place,",renaissance
With panting hounds beguiled of their prey:,renaissance
"So after long pursuit and vain assay,",renaissance
"When I all weary had the chase forsook,",renaissance
"The gentle deer return'd the self-same way,",renaissance
Thinking to quench her thirst at the next brook.,renaissance
"There she beholding me with milder look,",renaissance
"Sought not to fly, but fearless still did bide:",renaissance
"Till I in hand her yet half trembling took,",renaissance
And with her own goodwill her firmly tied.,renaissance
"Strange thing, me seem'd, to see a beast so wild,",renaissance
"So goodly won, with her own will beguil'd.",renaissance
"Most happy letters, fram'd by skilful trade,",renaissance
With which that happy name was first design'd:,renaissance
"The which three times thrice happy hath me made,",renaissance
"With gifts of body, fortune, and of mind.",renaissance
"The first my being to me gave by kind,",renaissance
"From mother's womb deriv'd by due descent,",renaissance
"The second is my sovereign Queen most kind,",renaissance
That honour and large richesse to me lent.,renaissance
"The third my love, my life's last ornament,",renaissance
By whom my spirit out of dust was raised:,renaissance
"To speak her praise and glory excellent,",renaissance
Of all alive most worthy to be praised.,renaissance
"Ye three Elizabeths for ever live,",renaissance
That three such graces did unto me give.,renaissance
"Men call you fair, and you do credit it,",renaissance
For that your self ye daily such do see:,renaissance
"But the true fair, that is the gentle wit,",renaissance
"And vertuous mind, is much more prais'd of me.",renaissance
"For all the rest, how ever fair it be,",renaissance
Shall turn to naught and lose that glorious hue:,renaissance
But only that is permanent and free,renaissance
"From frail corruption, that doth flesh ensue.",renaissance
That is true beauty: that doth argue you,renaissance
"To be divine, and born of heavenly seed:",renaissance
"Deriv'd from that fair Spirit, from whom all true",renaissance
And perfect beauty did at first proceed.,renaissance
"He only fair, and what he fair hath made,",renaissance
"All other fair, like flowers untimely fade.",renaissance
"One day I wrote her name upon the strand,",renaissance
But came the waves and washed it away:,renaissance
"Again I wrote it with a second hand,",renaissance
"But came the tide, and made my pains his prey.",renaissance
"Vain man, said she, ""that dost in vain assay,",renaissance
A mortal thing so to immortalize;,renaissance
"For I myself shall like to this decay,",renaissance

For my sweet saint some service fit will find.,renaissance

Like sacred priests that never think amiss.,renaissance
"There I to her as th' author of my bliss,",renaissance
Will build an altar to appease her ire:,renaissance
"And on the same my heart will sacrifice,",renaissance
Burning in flames of pure and chaste desire:,renaissance
"The which vouchsafe, O goddess, to accept,",renaissance
Amongst thy dearest relics to be kept.,renaissance
"AH whither, Love, wilt thou now carry me?",renaissance
What wontless fury dost thou now inspire,renaissance
"Into my feeble breast, too full of thee?",renaissance
"Whilst seeking to aslake thy raging fire,",renaissance
"Thou in me kindlest much more great desire,",renaissance
And up aloft above my strength dost raise,renaissance
The wondrous matter of my fire to praise.,renaissance
"That as I erst in praise of thine own name,",renaissance
"So now in honour of thy mother dear,",renaissance
"An honourable hymn I eke should frame,",renaissance
"And with the brightness of her beauty clear,",renaissance
The ravish'd hearts of gazeful men might rear,renaissance
"To admiration of that heavenly light,",renaissance
From whence proceeds such soul-enchanting might.,renaissance
"Thereto do thou, great goddess, queen of beauty,",renaissance
"Mother of love, and of all world's delight,",renaissance
Without whose sovereign grace and kindly duty,renaissance
"Nothing on earth seems fair to fleshly sight,",renaissance
Do thou vouchsafe with thy love-kindling light,renaissance
"T' illuminate my dim and dulled eyne,",renaissance
And beautify this sacred hymn of thine:,renaissance
"That both to thee, to whom I mean it most,",renaissance
"And eke to her, whose fair immortal beam",renaissance
"Hath darted fire into my feeble ghost,",renaissance
"That now it wasted is with woes extreme,",renaissance
"It may so please, that she at length will stream",renaissance
"Some dew of grace into my withered heart,",renaissance
After long sorrow and consuming smart.,renaissance
WHAT time this world's great Workmaster did cast,renaissance
"To make all things such as we now behold,",renaissance
It seems that he before his eyes had plac'd,renaissance
"A goodly pattern, to whose perfect mould",renaissance
He fashion'd them as comely as he could;,renaissance
"That now so fair and seemly they appear,",renaissance
As nought may be amended anywhere.,renaissance
"That wondrous pattern, wheresoe'er it be,",renaissance
"Whether in earth laid up in secret store,",renaissance
"Or else in heaven, that no man may it see",renaissance
"With sinful eyes, for fear it to deflore,",renaissance
"Is perfect Beauty, which all men adore;",renaissance
Whose face and feature doth so much excel,renaissance
"All mortal sense, that none the same may tell.",renaissance
Thereof as every earthly thing partakes,renaissance
"Or more or less, by influence divine,",renaissance
"So it more fair accordingly it makes,",renaissance
"And the gross matter of this earthly mine,",renaissance
"Which clotheth it, thereafter doth refine,",renaissance
Doing away the dross which dims the light,renaissance
Of that fair beam which therein is empight.,renaissance
"For, through infusion of celestial power,",renaissance
"The duller earth it quick'neth with delight,",renaissance
And lifeful spirits privily doth pour,renaissance
"Through all the parts, that to the looker's sight",renaissance
"They seem to please. That is thy sovereign might,",renaissance
"O Cyprian queen, which flowing from the beam",renaissance
"Of thy bright star, thou into them dost stream.",renaissance
That is the thing which giveth pleasant grace,renaissance
"To all things fair, that kindleth lively fire,",renaissance
"Light of thy lamp, which, shining in the face,",renaissance
"Thence to the soul darts amorous desire,",renaissance
And robs the hearts of those which it admire;,renaissance
"Therewith thou pointest thy son's poison'd arrow,",renaissance
"That wounds the life, and wastes the inmost marrow.",renaissance
"How vainly then do idle wits invent,",renaissance
That beauty is nought else but mixture made,renaissance
"Of colours fair, and goodly temp'rament",renaissance
"Of pure complexions, that shall quickly fade",renaissance
"And pass away, like to a summer's shade;",renaissance
Or that it is but comely composition,renaissance
"Of parts well measur'd, with meet disposition.",renaissance
"Hath white and red in it such wondrous power,",renaissance
"That it can pierce through th' eyes unto the heart,",renaissance
"And therein stir such rage and restless stour,",renaissance
As nought but death can stint his dolour's smart?,renaissance
Or can proportion of the outward part,renaissance
"Move such affection in the inward mind,",renaissance
That it can rob both sense and reason blind?,renaissance
"Why do not then the blossoms of the field,",renaissance
"Which are array'd with much more orient hue,",renaissance
"And to the sense most dainty odours yield,",renaissance
Work like impression in the looker's view?,renaissance
"Or why do not fair pictures like power shew,",renaissance
In which oft-times we nature see of art,renaissance
"Excell'd, in perfect limning every part?",renaissance
"But ah, believe me, there is more than so,",renaissance
That works such wonders in the minds of men;,renaissance
"I, that have often prov'd, too well it know,",renaissance
"And whoso list the like assays to ken,",renaissance
"Shall find by trial, and confess it then,",renaissance
"That beauty is not, as fond men misdeem,",renaissance
"An outward shew of things, that only seem.",renaissance
"For that same goodly hue of white and red,",renaissance
"With which the cheeks are sprinkled, shall decay,",renaissance
"And those sweet rosy leaves, so fairly spread",renaissance
"Upon the lips, shall fade and fall away",renaissance
"To that they were, even to corrupted clay;",renaissance
"That golden wire, those sparkling stars so bright,",renaissance
Shall turn to dust; and lose their goodly light.,renaissance
"But that fair lamp, from whose celestial ray",renaissance
"That light proceeds, which kindleth lovers' fire,",renaissance
Shall never be extinguish'd nor decay;,renaissance
"But when the vital spirits do expire,",renaissance
Unto her native planet shall retire;,renaissance
"For it is heavenly born and cannot die,",renaissance
Being a parcel of the purest sky.,renaissance
"For when the soul, the which derived was,",renaissance
"At first, out of that great immortal Spright,",renaissance
"By whom all live to love, whilom did pass",renaissance
Down from the top of purest heaven's height,renaissance
"To be embodied here, it then took light",renaissance
"And lively spirits from that fairest star,",renaissance
Which lights the world forth from his fiery car.,renaissance
"Which power retaining still or more or less,",renaissance
"When she in fleshly seed is eft enraced,",renaissance
"Through every part she doth the same impress,",renaissance
"According as the heavens have her graced,",renaissance
"And frames her house, in which she will be placed,",renaissance
"Fit for herself, adorning it with spoil",renaissance
Of th' heavenly riches which she robb'd erewhile.,renaissance
"Thereof it comes that these fair souls, which have",renaissance
"The most resemblance of that heavenly light,",renaissance
Frame to themselves most beautiful and brave,renaissance
"Their fleshly bower, most fit for their delight,",renaissance
And the gross matter by a sovereign might,renaissance
"Tempers so trim, that it may well be seen",renaissance
A palace fit for such a virgin queen.,renaissance
"So every spirit, as it is most pure,",renaissance
"And hath in it the more of heavenly light,",renaissance
So it the fairer body doth procure,renaissance
"To habit in, and it more fairly dight",renaissance
With cheerful grace and amiable sight.,renaissance
For of the soul the body form doth take:,renaissance
"For soul is form, and doth the body make.",renaissance
Therefore wherever that thou dost behold,renaissance
"A comely corpse, with beauty fair endued,",renaissance
"Know this for certain, that the same doth hold",renaissance
"A beauteous soul, with fair conditions thewed,",renaissance
Fit to receive the seed of virtue strewed.,renaissance
"For all that fair is, is by nature good;",renaissance
That is a sign to know the gentle blood.,renaissance
Yet oft it falls that many a gentle mind,renaissance
"Dwells in deformed tabernacle drown'd,",renaissance
"Either by chance, against the course of kind,",renaissance
"Or through unaptness in the substance found,",renaissance
"Which it assumed of some stubborn ground,",renaissance
"That will not yield unto her form's direction,",renaissance
But is deform'd with some foul imperfection.,renaissance
"And oft it falls, (ay me, the more to rue)",renaissance
"That goodly beauty, albe heavenly born,",renaissance
"Is foul abus'd, and that celestial hue,",renaissance
"Which doth the world with her delight adorn,",renaissance
"Made but the bait of sin, and sinners' scorn,",renaissance
"Whilst every one doth seek and sue to have it,",renaissance
But every one doth seek but to deprave it.,renaissance
"Yet nathemore is that fair beauty's blame,",renaissance
But theirs that do abuse it unto ill:,renaissance
"Nothing so good, but that through guilty shame",renaissance
"May be corrupt, and wrested unto will:",renaissance
"Natheless the soul is fair and beauteous still,",renaissance
"However flesh{""e}s fault it filthy make;",renaissance
For things immortal no corruption take.,renaissance
"But ye fair dames, the world's dear ornaments",renaissance
"And lively images of heaven's light,",renaissance
Let not your beams with such disparagements,renaissance
"Be dimm'd, and your bright glory dark'ned quite;",renaissance
"But mindful still of your first country's sight,",renaissance
"Do still preserve your first informed grace,",renaissance
Whose shadow yet shines in your beauteous face.,renaissance
"Loathe that foul blot, that hellish firebrand,",renaissance
"Disloyal lust, fair beauty's foulest blame,",renaissance
"That base affections, which your ears would bland,",renaissance
"Commend to you by love's abused name,",renaissance
But is indeed the bondslave of defame;,renaissance
"Which will the garland of your glory mar,",renaissance
And quench the light of your bright shining star.,renaissance
"But gentle Love, that loyal is and true,",renaissance
"Will more illumine your resplendent ray,",renaissance
"And add more brightness to your goodly hue,",renaissance
"From light of his pure fire; which, by like way",renaissance
"Kindled of yours, your likeness doth display;",renaissance
"Like as two mirrors, by oppos'd reflection,",renaissance
Do both express the face's first impression.,renaissance
"Therefore, to make your beauty more appear,",renaissance
"It you behoves to love, and forth to lay",renaissance
"That heavenly riches which in you ye bear,",renaissance
That men the more admire their fountain may;,renaissance
"For else what booteth that celestial ray,",renaissance
"If it in darkness be enshrined ever,",renaissance
That it of loving eyes be viewed never?,renaissance
"But, in your choice of loves, this well advise,",renaissance
"That likest to yourselves ye them select,",renaissance
"The which your forms' first source may sympathize,",renaissance
And with like beauty's parts be inly deckt;,renaissance
"For, if you loosely love without respect,",renaissance
"It is no love, but a discordant war,",renaissance
Whose unlike parts amongst themselves do jar.,renaissance
For love is a celestial harmony,renaissance
"Of likely hearts compos'd of stars' concent,",renaissance
"Which join together in sweet sympathy,",renaissance
"To work each other's joy and true content,",renaissance
Which they have harbour'd since their first descent,renaissance
"Out of their heavenly bowers, where they did see",renaissance
And know each other here belov'd to be.,renaissance
Then wrong it were that any other twain,renaissance
Should in love's gentle band combined be,renaissance
"But those whom Heaven did at first ordain,",renaissance
And made out of one mould the more t' agree;,renaissance
"For all that like the beauty which they see,",renaissance
Straight do not love; for love is not so light,renaissance
As straight to burn at first beholder's sight.,renaissance
"But they, which love indeed, look otherwise,",renaissance
"With pure regard and spotless true intent,",renaissance
Drawing out of the object of their eyes,renaissance
"A more refined form, which they present",renaissance
"Unto their mind, void of all blemishment;",renaissance
"Which it reducing to her first perfection,",renaissance
Beholdeth free from flesh's frail infection.,renaissance
"And then conforming it unto the light,",renaissance
"Which in itself it hath remaining still,",renaissance
"Of that first Sun, yet sparkling in his sight,",renaissance
Thereof he fashions in his higher skill,renaissance
An heavenly beauty to his fancy's will;,renaissance
"And it embracing in his mind entire,",renaissance
The mirror of his own thought doth admire.,renaissance
"Which seeing now so inly fair to be,",renaissance
"As outward it appeareth to the eye,",renaissance
"And with his spirit's proportion to agree,",renaissance
"He thereon fixeth all his fantasy,",renaissance
And fully setteth his felicity;,renaissance
"Counting it fairer than it is indeed,",renaissance
And yet indeed her fairness doth exceed.,renaissance
For lovers' eyes more sharply sighted be,renaissance
"Than other men's, and in dear love's delight",renaissance
"See more than any other eyes can see,",renaissance
"Through mutual receipt of beam{""e}s bright,",renaissance
"Which carry privy message to the spright,",renaissance
"And to their eyes that inmost fair display,",renaissance
As plain as light discovers dawning day.,renaissance
"Therein they see, through amorous eye-glances,",renaissance
"Armies of loves still flying to and fro,",renaissance
Which dart at them their little fiery lances;,renaissance
"Whom having wounded, back again they go,",renaissance
Carrying compassion to their lovely foe;,renaissance
"Who, seeing her fair eyes' so sharp effect,",renaissance
Cures all their sorrows with one sweet aspect.,renaissance
In which how many wonders do they rede,renaissance
"To their conceit, that others never see,",renaissance
"Now of her smiles, with which their souls they feed,",renaissance
Like gods with nectar in their banquets free;,renaissance
"Now of her looks, which like to cordials be;",renaissance
"But when her words' embassade forth she sends,",renaissance
"Lord, how sweet music that unto them lends.",renaissance
Sometimes upon her forehead they behold,renaissance
A thousand graces masking in delight;,renaissance
Sometimes within her eyelids they unfold,renaissance
"Ten thousand sweet belgards, which to their sight",renaissance
Do seem like twinkling stars in frosty night;,renaissance
"But on her lips, like rosy buds in May,",renaissance
So many millions of chaste pleasures play.,renaissance
"All those, O Cytherea, and thousands more",renaissance
"Thy handmaids be, which do on thee attend,",renaissance
"To deck thy beauty with their dainties' store,",renaissance
"That may it more to mortal eyes commend,",renaissance
And make it more admir'd of foe and friend:,renaissance
"That in men's hearts thou may'st thy throne install,",renaissance
And spread thy lovely kingdom over all.,renaissance
"Then Io, triumph! O great Beauty's Queen,",renaissance
"Advance the banner of thy conquest high,",renaissance
"That all this world, the which thy vassals bene,",renaissance
"May draw to thee, and with due fealty",renaissance
"Adore the power of thy great majesty,",renaissance
"Singing this hymn in honour of thy name,",renaissance
"Compil'd by me, which thy poor liegeman am.",renaissance
"In lieu whereof grant, O great sovereign,",renaissance
That she whose conquering beauty doth captive,renaissance
"My trembling heart in her eternal chain,",renaissance
"One drop of grace at length will to me give,",renaissance
"That I her bounden thrall by her may live,",renaissance
"And this same life, which first fro me she reaved,",renaissance
"May owe to her, of whom I it received.",renaissance
"And you, fair Venus' darling, my dear dread,",renaissance
"Fresh flower of grace, great goddess of my life,",renaissance
"When your fair eyes these fearful lines shall read,",renaissance
"Deign to let fall one drop of due relief,",renaissance
"That may recure my heart's long pining grief,",renaissance
"And shew what wondrous power your beauty hath,",renaissance
That can restore a damned wight from death.,renaissance
And wilt thou leave me thus?,renaissance
"Say nay, say nay, for shame,",renaissance
To save thee from the blame,renaissance
Of all my grief and grame;,renaissance
And wilt thou leave me thus?,renaissance
"Say nay, say nay!",renaissance
"And wilt thou leave me thus,",renaissance
That hath loved thee so long,renaissance
In wealth and woe among?,renaissance
And is thy heart so strong,renaissance
As for to leave me thus?,renaissance
"Say nay, say nay!",renaissance
"And wilt thou leave me thus,",renaissance
That hath given thee my heart,renaissance
"Never for to depart,",renaissance
Nother for pain nor smart;,renaissance
And wilt thou leave me thus?,renaissance
"Say nay, say nay!",renaissance
And wilt thou leave me thus,renaissance
And have no more pity,renaissance
Of him that loveth thee?,renaissance
"Helas, thy cruelty!",renaissance
And wilt thou leave me thus?,renaissance
"Say nay, say nay!Loving in truth, and fain in verse my love to show,",renaissance
"That she, dear she, might take some pleasure of my pain,",renaissance
"Pleasure might cause her read, reading might make her know,",renaissance
"Knowledge might pity win, and pity grace obtain,",renaissance
I sought fit words to paint the blackest face of woe;,renaissance
"Studying inventions fine her wits to entertain,",renaissance
"Oft turning others' leaves, to see if thence would flow",renaissance
Some fresh and fruitful showers upon my sunburn'd brain.,renaissance
"But words came halting forth, wanting invention's stay;",renaissance
"Invention, Nature's child, fled step-dame Study's blows;",renaissance
And others' feet still seem'd but strangers in my way.,renaissance
"Thus great with child to speak and helpless in my throes,",renaissance
"Biting my truant pen, beating myself for spite,",renaissance
"Fool, said my Muse to me, ""look in thy heart, and write.""",renaissance
You that do search for every purling spring,renaissance
"Which from the ribs of old Parnassus flows,",renaissance
"And every flower, not sweet perhaps, which grows",renaissance
"Near thereabouts, into your poesy wring;",renaissance
Ye that do dictionary's method bring,renaissance
"Into your rimes, running in rattling rows;",renaissance
You that poor Petrarch's long-deceased woes,renaissance
With new-born sighs and denizen'd wit do sing:,renaissance
You take wrong ways; those far-fet helps be such,renaissance
"As do bewray a want of inward touch,",renaissance
"And sure, at length stol'n goods do come to light.",renaissance
"But if, both for your love and skill, your name",renaissance
"You seek to nurse at fullest breasts of Fame,",renaissance
"Stella behold, and then begin to endite.",renaissance
"Fly, fly, my friends, I have my death wound, fly!",renaissance
"See there that boy, that murd'ring boy, I say,",renaissance
"Who, like a thief, hid in dark bush doth lie",renaissance
Till bloody bullet get him wrongful prey.,renaissance
"So tyrant he no fitter place could spy,",renaissance
"Nor so fair level in so secret stay,",renaissance
As that sweet black which veils the heav'nly eye;,renaissance
There himself with his shot he close doth lay.,renaissance
"Poor passenger, pass now thereby I did,",renaissance
"And stay'd, pleas'd with the prospect of the place,",renaissance
While that black hue from me the bad guest hid;,renaissance
But straight I saw motions of lightning grace,renaissance
And then descried the glist'ring of his dart:,renaissance
But ere I could fly thence it pierc'd my heart.,renaissance
"The curious wits, seeing dull pensiveness",renaissance
"Bewray itself in my long-settl'd eyes,",renaissance
"Whence those same fumes of melancholy rise,",renaissance
With idle pains and missing aim do guess.,renaissance
"Some, that know how my spring I did address,",renaissance
Deem that my Muse some fruit of knowledge plies;,renaissance
"Others, because the prince my service tries,",renaissance
Think that I think state errors to redress;,renaissance
But harder judges judge ambition's ragei,renaissance
"Scourge of itself, still climbing slipp'ry placei",renaissance
Holds my young brain captiv'd in golden cage.,renaissance
"O fool or over-wise! alas, the race",renaissance
Of all my thoughts hath neither stop nor start,renaissance
But only Stella's eyes and Stella's heart.,renaissance
"Let dainty wits cry on the sisters nine,",renaissance
"That, bravely mask'd, their fancies may be told;",renaissance
"Or, Pindar's apes, flaunt they in phrases fine,",renaissance
Enam'ling with pied flowers their thoughts of gold.,renaissance
"Or else let them in statelier glory shine,",renaissance
Ennobling newfound tropes with problems old;,renaissance
"Or with strange similes enrich each line,",renaissance
Of herbs or beasts which Ind or Afric hold.,renaissance
"For me, in sooth, no Muse but one I know;",renaissance
"Phrases and problems from my reach do grow,",renaissance
And strange things cost too dear for my poor sprites.,renaissance
How then? even thus: in Stella's face I read,renaissance
What love and beauty be; then all my deed,renaissance
"But copying is, what in her Nature writes.",renaissance
"With how sad steps, O Moon, thou climb'st the skies!",renaissance
"How silently, and with how wan a face!",renaissance
"What, may it be that even in heav'nly place",renaissance
That busy archer his sharp arrows tries!,renaissance
"Sure, if that long-with love-acquainted eyes",renaissance
"Can judge of love, thou feel'st a lover's case,",renaissance
I read it in thy looks; thy languish'd grace,renaissance
"To me, that feel the like, thy state descries.",renaissance
"Then, ev'n of fellowship, O Moon, tell me,",renaissance
Is constant love deem'd there but want of wit?,renaissance
Are beauties there as proud as here they be?,renaissance
"Do they above love to be lov'd, and yet",renaissance
Those lovers scorn whom that love doth possess?,renaissance
Do they call virtue there ungratefulness?,renaissance
"I might!unhappy wordO me, I might,",renaissance
"And then would not, or could not, see my bliss;",renaissance
"Till now wrapt in a most infernal night,",renaissance
"I find how heav'nly day, wretch! I did miss.",renaissance
"Heart, rend thyself, thou dost thyself but right;",renaissance
"No lovely Paris made thy Helen his,",renaissance
"No force, no fraud robb'd thee of thy delight,",renaissance
Nor Fortune of thy fortune author is;,renaissance
"But to myself myself did give the blow,",renaissance
"While too much wit, forsooth, so troubled me",renaissance
That I respects for both our sakes must show:,renaissance
And yet could not by rising morn foresee,renaissance
"How fair a day was near: O punish'd eyes,",renaissance
"That I had been more foolish,or more wise!Come Sleep! O Sleep, the certain knot of peace,",renaissance
"The baiting-place of wit, the balm of woe,",renaissance
"The poor man's wealth, the prisoner's release,",renaissance
Th' indifferent judge between the high and low.,renaissance
With shield of proof shield me from out the prease,renaissance
Of those fierce darts despair at me doth throw:,renaissance
O make in me those civil wars to cease;,renaissance
"I will good tribute pay, if thou do so.",renaissance
"Take thou of me smooth pillows, sweetest bed,",renaissance
"A chamber deaf to noise and blind to light,",renaissance
A rosy garland and a weary head:,renaissance
"And if these things, as being thine by right,",renaissance
"Move not thy heavy grace, thou shalt in me,",renaissance
"Livelier than elsewhere, Stella's image see.",renaissance
"Having this day my horse, my hand, my lance",renaissance
"Guided so well that I obtain'd the prize,",renaissance
Both by the judgment of the English eyes,renaissance
And of some sent from that sweet enemy France;,renaissance
"Horsemen my skill in horsemanship advance,",renaissance
Town folks my strength; a daintier judge applies,renaissance
His praise to sleight which from good use doth rise;,renaissance
Some lucky wits impute it but to chance;,renaissance
"Others, because of both sides I do take",renaissance
"My blood from them who did excel in this,",renaissance
Think Nature me a man of arms did make.,renaissance
"How far they shot awry! The true cause is,",renaissance
"Stella look'd on, and from her heav'nly face",renaissance
Sent forth the beams which made so fair my race.,renaissance
"No more, my dear, no more these counsels try;",renaissance
"Oh, give my passions leave to run their race;",renaissance
Let Fortune lay on me her worst disgrace;,renaissance
Let folk o'ercharg'd with brain against me cry;,renaissance
"Let clouds bedim my face, break in mine eye;",renaissance
Let me no steps but of lost labour trace;,renaissance
"Let all the earth with scorn recount my case,",renaissance
But do not will me from my love to fly.,renaissance
"I do not envy Aristotle's wit,",renaissance
Nor do aspire to Caesar's bleeding fame;,renaissance
Nor aught do care though some above me sit;,renaissance
"Nor hope nor wish another course to frame,",renaissance
But that which once may win thy cruel heart:,renaissance
"Thou art my wit, and thou my virtue art.",renaissance
"When Nature made her chief work, Stella's eyes,",renaissance
In colour black why wrapt she beams so bright?,renaissance
"Would she in beamy black, like painter wise,",renaissance
"Frame daintiest lustre, mix'd of shades and light?",renaissance
"Or did she else that sober hue devise,",renaissance
In object best to knit and strength our sight;,renaissance
"Lest, if no veil these brave gleams did disguise,",renaissance
"They, sunlike, should more dazzle than delight?",renaissance
"Or would she her miraculous power show,",renaissance
"That, whereas black seems beauty's contrary,",renaissance
She even in black doth make all beauties flow?,renaissance
"Both so, and thus, she, minding Love should be",renaissance
"Plac'd ever there, gave him this mourning weed",renaissance
To honour all their deaths who for her bleed.,renaissance
Who will in fairest book of nature know,renaissance
"How virtue may best lodg'd in beauty be,",renaissance
"Let him but learn of love to read in thee,",renaissance
"Stella, those fair lines which true goodness show.",renaissance
"There shall he find all vices' overthrow,",renaissance
"Not by rude force, but sweetest sovereignty",renaissance
"Of reason, from whose light those night-birds fly;",renaissance
That inward sun in thine eyes shineth so.,renaissance
"And, not content to be perfection's heir",renaissance
"Thyself, dost strive all minds that way to move,",renaissance
Who mark in thee what is in thee most fair.,renaissance
"So while thy beauty draws thy heart to love,",renaissance
As fast thy virtue bends that love to good:,renaissance
"But ""Ah,"" Desire still cries, ""Give me some food!""",renaissance
"Highway, since you my chief Parnassus be,",renaissance
"And that my Muse, to some ears not unsweet,",renaissance
Tempers her words to trampling horses' feet,renaissance
More oft than to a chamber melody.,renaissance
"Now, blessed you bear onward blessed me",renaissance
"To her, where I my heart, safe-left, shall meet:",renaissance
My Muse and I must you of duty greet,renaissance
"With thanks and wishes, wishing thankfully.",renaissance
"Be you still fair, honour'd by public heed;",renaissance
"By no encroachment wrong'd, nor time forgot,",renaissance
"Nor blam'd for blood, nor sham'd for sinful deed;",renaissance
And that you know I envy you no lot,renaissance
"Of highest wish, I wish you so much bliss,i",renaissance
Hundreds of years you Stella's feet may kiss.,renaissance
"Be your words made, good sir, of Indian ware,",renaissance
That you allow me them by so small rate?,renaissance
Or do you cutted Spartans imitate?,renaissance
"Or do you mean my tender ears to spare,",renaissance
That to my questions you so total are?,renaissance
"When I demand of Phoenix Stella's state,",renaissance
"You say, forsooth, you left her well of late:",renaissance
"O God, think you that satisfies my care?",renaissance
I would know whether she did sit or walk;,renaissance
"How cloth'd, how waited on; sigh'd she, or smil'd;",renaissance
"Whereof, with whom, how often did she talk;",renaissance
With what pastime time's journey she beguiled;,renaissance
If her lips deign'd to sweeten my poor name.,renaissance
"Say all; and all well said, still say the same.",renaissance
Avising the bright beams of these fair eyes,renaissance
"Where he is that mine oft moisteth and washeth,",renaissance
The wearied mind straight from the heart departeth,renaissance
For to rest in his worldly paradise,renaissance
And find the sweet bitter under this guise.,renaissance
What webs he hath wrought well he perceiveth,renaissance
Whereby with himself on love he plaineth,renaissance
That spurreth with fire and bridleth with ice.,renaissance
"Thus is it in such extremity brought,",renaissance
"In frozen thought, now and now it standeth in flame.",renaissance
"Twixt misery and wealth, twixt earnest and game,",renaissance
"But few glad, and many diverse thought",renaissance
With sore repentance of his hardiness.,renaissance
Of such a root cometh fruit fruitless.,renaissance
"Come live with me, and be my love,",renaissance
And we will some new pleasures prove,renaissance
"Of golden sands, and crystal brooks,",renaissance
"With silken lines, and silver hooks.",renaissance
There will the river whispering run,renaissance
"Warm'd by thy eyes, more than the sun;",renaissance
"And there the 'enamour'd fish will stay,",renaissance
Begging themselves they may betray.,renaissance
"When thou wilt swim in that live bath,",renaissance
"Each fish, which every channel hath,",renaissance
"Will amorously to thee swim,",renaissance
"Gladder to catch thee, than thou him.",renaissance
"If thou, to be so seen, be'st loth,",renaissance
"By sun or moon, thou dark'nest both,",renaissance
"And if myself have leave to see,",renaissance
I need not their light having thee.,renaissance
"Let others freeze with angling reeds,",renaissance
"And cut their legs with shells and weeds,",renaissance
"Or treacherously poor fish beset,",renaissance
"With strangling snare, or windowy net.",renaissance
Let coarse bold hands from slimy nest,renaissance
The bedded fish in banks out-wrest;,renaissance
"Or curious traitors, sleeve-silk flies,",renaissance
Bewitch poor fishes' wand'ring eyes.,renaissance
"For thee, thou need'st no such deceit,",renaissance
For thou thyself art thine own bait:,renaissance
"That fish, that is not catch'd thereby,",renaissance
"Alas, is wiser far than I.",renaissance
"For God's sake hold your tongue, and let me love,",renaissance
"         Or chide my palsy, or my gout,",renaissance
"My five gray hairs, or ruined fortune flout,",renaissance
"         With wealth your state, your mind with arts improve,",renaissance
"                Take you a course, get you a place,",renaissance
"                Observe his honor, or his grace,",renaissance
"Or the king's real, or his stamped face",renaissance
"         Contemplate; what you will, approve,",renaissance
         So you will let me love.,renaissance
"Alas, alas, who's injured by my love?",renaissance
         What merchant's ships have my sighs drowned?,renaissance
Who says my tears have overflowed his ground?,renaissance
         When did my colds a forward spring remove?,renaissance
                When did the heats which my veins fill,renaissance
                Add one more to the plaguy bill?,renaissance
"Soldiers find wars, and lawyers find out still",renaissance
"         Litigious men, which quarrels move,",renaissance
         Though she and I do love.,renaissance

"So, to one neutral thing both sexes fit.",renaissance
"         We die and rise the same, and prove",renaissance
         Mysterious by this love.,renaissance
"We can die by it, if not live by love,",renaissance
         And if unfit for tombs and hearse,renaissance
"Our legend be, it will be fit for verse;",renaissance
"         And if no piece of chronicle we prove,",renaissance
                We'll build in sonnets pretty rooms;,renaissance

"The greatest ashes, as half-acre tombs,",renaissance
"         And by these hymns, all shall approve",renaissance
         Us canonized for Love.,renaissance
"And thus invoke us: ""You, whom reverend love",renaissance
         Made one another's hermitage;,renaissance
"You, to whom love was peace, that now is rage;",renaissance
"         Who did the whole world's soul contract, and drove",renaissance
                Into the glasses of your eyes,renaissance
"                (So made such mirrors, and such spies,",renaissance
That they did all to you epitomize),renaissance
"         Countries, towns, courts: beg from above",renaissance
"         A pattern of your love!""Let it not your wonder move,",renaissance

"Though I now write fifty years,",renaissance
"I have had, and have, my peers;",renaissance
"Poets, though divine, are men,",renaissance
Some have lov'd as old again.,renaissance
"And it is not always face,",renaissance
"Clothes, or fortune, gives the grace;",renaissance
"Or the feature, or the youth.",renaissance
"But the language and the truth,",renaissance
"With the ardour and the passion,",renaissance
Gives the lover weight and fashion.,renaissance
"If you then will read the story,",renaissance
First prepare you to be sorry,renaissance
That you never knew till now,renaissance
Either whom to love or how;,renaissance
"But be glad, as soon with me,",renaissance
When you know that this is she,renaissance
Of whose beauty it was sung;,renaissance
"She shall make the old man young,",renaissance
"Keep the middle age at stay,",renaissance
"And let nothing high decay,",renaissance
Till she be the reason why,renaissance
All the world for love may die.,renaissance
"See the chariot at hand here of Love,",renaissance
Wherein my lady rideth!,renaissance
"Each that draws is a swan or a dove,",renaissance
And well the car Love guideth.,renaissance
"As she goes, all hearts do duty",renaissance
Unto her beauty;,renaissance
"And enamour'd, do wish, so they might",renaissance
"But enjoy such a sight,",renaissance
"That they still were to run by her side,",renaissance
"Through swords, through seas, whither she would ride.",renaissance
"Do but look on her eyes, they do light",renaissance
All that Love's world compriseth!,renaissance
"Do but look on her hair, it is bright",renaissance
As Love's star when it riseth!,renaissance
"Do but mark, her forehead's smoother",renaissance
Than words that soothe her;,renaissance
"And from her arched brows, such a grace",renaissance
Sheds itself through the face,renaissance
As alone there triumphs to the life,renaissance
"All the gain, all the good, of the elements' strife.",renaissance
"Have you seen but a bright lily grow,",renaissance
Before rude hands have touch'd it?,renaissance
Ha' you mark'd but the fall o' the snow,renaissance
Before the soil hath smutch'd it?,renaissance
Ha' you felt the wool o' the beaver?,renaissance
Or swan's down ever?,renaissance
Or have smelt o' the bud o' the briar?,renaissance
Or the nard in the fire?,renaissance
Or have tasted the bag of the bee?,renaissance
Oh so white! Oh so soft! Oh so sweet is she!,renaissance
"Muses that sing love's sensual empery,",renaissance
And lovers kindling your enraged fires,renaissance
"At Cupid's bonfires burning in the eye,",renaissance
Blown with the empty breath of vain desires;,renaissance
You that prefer the painted cabinet,renaissance
"Before the wealthy jewels it doth store ye,",renaissance
"That all your joys in dying figures set,",renaissance
And stain the living substance of your glory;,renaissance
"Abjure those joys, abhor their memory,",renaissance
And let my love the honour'd subject be,renaissance
"Of love, and honour's complete history.",renaissance
Your eyes were never yet let in to see,renaissance
"The majesty and riches of the mind,",renaissance
But dwell in darkness; for your god is blind.,renaissance
"Dear love, for nothing less than thee",renaissance
Would I have broke this happy dream;,renaissance
            It was a theme,renaissance
"For reason, much too strong for fantasy,",renaissance
Therefore thou wak'd'st me wisely; yet,renaissance
"My dream thou brok'st not, but continued'st it.",renaissance
Thou art so true that thoughts of thee suffice,renaissance
"To make dreams truths, and fables histories;",renaissance
"Enter these arms, for since thou thought'st it best,",renaissance
"Not to dream all my dream, let's act the rest.",renaissance
"   As lightning, or a taper's light,",renaissance
"Thine eyes, and not thy noise wak'd me;",renaissance
            Yet I thought thee,renaissance
"(For thou lovest truth) an angel, at first sight;",renaissance
"But when I saw thou sawest my heart,",renaissance
"And knew'st my thoughts, beyond an angel's art,",renaissance
"When thou knew'st what I dreamt, when thou knew'st when",renaissance
"Excess of joy would wake me, and cam'st then,",renaissance
"I must confess, it could not choose but be",renaissance
"Profane, to think thee any thing but thee.",renaissance
"   Coming and staying show'd thee, thee,",renaissance
"But rising makes me doubt, that now",renaissance
            Thou art not thou.,renaissance
That love is weak where fear's as strong as he;,renaissance
"'Tis not all spirit, pure and brave,",renaissance
"If mixture it of fear, shame, honour have;",renaissance
"Perchance as torches, which must ready be,",renaissance
"Men light and put out, so thou deal'st with me;",renaissance
"Thou cam'st to kindle, goest to come; then I",renaissance
"Will dream that hope again, but else would die.",renaissance
"Where, like a pillow on a bed",renaissance
         A pregnant bank swell'd up to rest,renaissance
"The violet's reclining head,",renaissance
"         Sat we two, one another's best.",renaissance
Our hands were firmly cemented,renaissance
"         With a fast balm, which thence did spring;",renaissance
"Our eye-beams twisted, and did thread",renaissance
         Our eyes upon one double string;,renaissance
"So to'intergraft our hands, as yet",renaissance
"         Was all the means to make us one,",renaissance
And pictures in our eyes to get,renaissance
         Was all our propagation.,renaissance
As 'twixt two equal armies fate,renaissance
"         Suspends uncertain victory,",renaissance
Our souls (which to advance their state,renaissance
         Were gone out) hung 'twixt her and me.,renaissance
"And whilst our souls negotiate there,",renaissance
         We like sepulchral statues lay;,renaissance
"All day, the same our postures were,",renaissance
"         And we said nothing, all the day.",renaissance
"If any, so by love refin'd",renaissance
"         That he soul's language understood,",renaissance
"And by good love were grown all mind,",renaissance
"         Within convenient distance stood,",renaissance
"He (though he knew not which soul spake,",renaissance
"         Because both meant, both spake the same)",renaissance
Might thence a new concoction take,renaissance
         And part far purer than he came.,renaissance
"This ecstasy doth unperplex,",renaissance
"         We said, and tell us what we love;",renaissance
"We see by this it was not sex,",renaissance
         We see we saw not what did move;,renaissance
But as all several souls contain,renaissance
"         Mixture of things, they know not what,",renaissance
Love these mix'd souls doth mix again,renaissance
"         And makes both one, each this and that.",renaissance
"A single violet transplant,",renaissance
"         The strength, the colour, and the size,",renaissance
(All which before was poor and scant),renaissance
"         Redoubles still, and multiplies.",renaissance
When love with one another so,renaissance
"         Interinanimates two souls,",renaissance
"That abler soul, which thence doth flow,",renaissance
         Defects of loneliness controls.,renaissance
"We then, who are this new soul, know",renaissance
"         Of what we are compos'd and made,",renaissance
For th' atomies of which we grow,renaissance
"         Are souls, whom no change can invade.",renaissance
"But oh alas, so long, so far,",renaissance
         Our bodies why do we forbear?,renaissance
"They'are ours, though they'are not we; we are",renaissance
"         The intelligences, they the spheres.",renaissance
"We owe them thanks, because they thus",renaissance
"         Did us, to us, at first convey,",renaissance
"Yielded their senses' force to us,",renaissance
"         Nor are dross to us, but allay.",renaissance
"On man heaven's influence works not so,",renaissance
         But that it first imprints the air;,renaissance
"So soul into the soul may flow,",renaissance
            Though it to body first repair.,renaissance
As our blood labors to beget,renaissance
"         Spirits, as like souls as it can,",renaissance
Because such fingers need to knit,renaissance
"         That subtle knot which makes us man,",renaissance
So must pure lovers' souls descend,renaissance
"         T' affections, and to faculties,",renaissance
"Which sense may reach and apprehend,",renaissance
         Else a great prince in prison lies.,renaissance
"To'our bodies turn we then, that so",renaissance
         Weak men on love reveal'd may look;,renaissance
"Love's mysteries in souls do grow,",renaissance
         But yet the body is his book.,renaissance
"And if some lover, such as we,",renaissance
"         Have heard this dialogue of one,",renaissance
"Let him still mark us, he shall see",renaissance
"         Small change, when we'are to bodies gone.",renaissance
         No spring nor summer beauty hath such grace,renaissance
         As I have seen in one autumnal face.,renaissance
"Young beauties force our love, and that's a rape,",renaissance
"         This doth but counsel, yet you cannot scape.",renaissance
"If 'twere a shame to love, here 'twere no shame;",renaissance
         Affection here takes reverence's name.,renaissance
"Were her first years the golden age? That's true,",renaissance
         But now she's gold oft tried and ever new.,renaissance
"That was her torrid and inflaming time,",renaissance
         This is her tolerable tropic clime.,renaissance
"Fair eyes, who asks more heat than comes from hence,",renaissance
         He in a fever wishes pestilence.,renaissance
"Call not these wrinkles, graves; if graves they were,",renaissance
"         They were Love's graves, for else he is no where.",renaissance
"Yet lies not Love dead here, but here doth sit",renaissance
"         Vow'd to this trench, like an anachorit;",renaissance
"And here till hers, which must be his death, come,",renaissance
"         He doth not dig a grave, but build a tomb.",renaissance
Here dwells he; though he sojourn ev'rywhere,renaissance
"         In progress, yet his standing house is here:",renaissance
"Here where still evening is, not noon nor night,",renaissance
"         Where no voluptuousness, yet all delight.",renaissance
"In all her words, unto all hearers fit,",renaissance
"         You may at revels, you at council, sit.",renaissance
"This is Love's timber, youth his underwood;",renaissance
"         There he, as wine in June, enrages blood,",renaissance
Which then comes seasonabliest when our taste,renaissance
         And appetite to other things is past.,renaissance
"Xerxes' strange Lydian love, the platan tree,",renaissance
"         Was lov'd for age, none being so large as she,",renaissance
"Or else because, being young, nature did bless",renaissance
"         Her youth with age's glory, barrenness.",renaissance
"If we love things long sought, age is a thing",renaissance
         Which we are fifty years in compassing;,renaissance
"If transitory things, which soon decay,",renaissance
         Age must be loveliest at the latest day.,renaissance
"But name not winter faces, whose skin's slack,",renaissance
"         Lank as an unthrift's purse, but a soul's sack;",renaissance
"Whose eyes seek light within, for all here's shade;",renaissance
"         Whose mouths are holes, rather worn out than made;",renaissance
"Whose every tooth to a several place is gone,",renaissance
         To vex their souls at resurrection:,renaissance
"Name not these living death's-heads unto me,",renaissance
"         For these, not ancient, but antique be.",renaissance
"I hate extremes, yet I had rather stay",renaissance
"         With tombs than cradles, to wear out a day.",renaissance
"Since such love's natural lation is, may still",renaissance
"         My love descend, and journey down the hill,",renaissance
"Not panting after growing beauties. So,",renaissance
         I shall ebb on with them who homeward go.,renaissance
         Here take my picture; though I bid farewell,renaissance
"Thine, in my heart, where my soul dwells, shall dwell.",renaissance
"'Tis like me now, but I dead, 'twill be more",renaissance
"When we are shadows both, than 'twas before.",renaissance
"When weather-beaten I come back, my hand",renaissance
"Perhaps with rude oars torn, or sun beams tann'd,",renaissance
"My face and breast of haircloth, and my head",renaissance
"With care's rash sudden storms being o'erspread,",renaissance
"My body'a sack of bones, broken within,",renaissance
And powder's blue stains scatter'd on my skin;,renaissance
If rival fools tax thee to'have lov'd a man,renaissance
"So foul and coarse as, oh, I may seem then,",renaissance
"This shall say what I was, and thou shalt say,",renaissance
Do his hurts reach me? doth my worth decay?,renaissance
"Or do they reach his judging mind, that he",renaissance
"Should now love less, what he did love to see?",renaissance
"That which in him was fair and delicate,",renaissance
Was but the milk which in love's childish state,renaissance
Did nurse it; who now is grown strong enough,renaissance
"To feed on that, which to disus'd tastes seems tough.",renaissance
Who is it that this dark night Underneath my window plaineth?,renaissance
It is one who from thy sight,renaissance
"Being, ah, exil'd, disdaineth",renaissance
Every other vulgar light.,renaissance
"Why, alas, and are you he?
Be not yet those fancies changed?",renaissance
"Dear, when you find change in me,",renaissance
"Though from me you be estranged,",renaissance
Let my change to ruin be.,renaissance
"Well, in absence this will die;
Leave to see, and leave to wonder.",renaissance
"Absence sure will help, if I",renaissance
Can learn how myself to sunder,renaissance
From what in my heart doth lie.,renaissance
"But time will these thoughts remove;
Time doth work what no man knoweth.",renaissance
Time doth as the subject prove;,renaissance
With time still the affection groweth,renaissance
In the faithful turtle-dove.,renaissance
"What if you new beauties see?
Will not they stir new affection?",renaissance
"I will think they pictures be,",renaissance
"Image-like, of saints' perfection,",renaissance
Poorly counterfeiting thee.,renaissance
"But your reason's purest light
Bids you leave such minds to nourish.",renaissance
"Dear, do reason no such spite;",renaissance
Never doth thy beauty flourish,renaissance
More than in my reason's sight.,renaissance
"But the wrongs love bears will make
Love at length leave undertaking.",renaissance
"No, the more fools it do shake,",renaissance
In a ground of so firm making,renaissance
Deeper still they drive the stake.,renaissance
"Peace, I think that some give ear!
Come no more, lest I get anger!",renaissance
"Bliss, I will my bliss forbear;",renaissance
"Fearing, sweet, you to endanger;",renaissance
But my soul shall harbour there.,renaissance
"Well, begone; begone, I say,
Lest that Argus' eyes perceive you!",renaissance
"Oh, unjust Fortune's sway,",renaissance
Which can make me thus to leave you;,renaissance
And from louts to run away.,renaissance
Farewell love and all thy laws forever;,renaissance
Thy baited hooks shall tangle me no more.,renaissance
Senec and Plato call me from thy lore,renaissance
"To perfect wealth, my wit for to endeavour.",renaissance
"In blind error when I did persever,",renaissance
"Thy sharp repulse, that pricketh aye so sore,",renaissance
Hath taught me to set in trifles no store,renaissance
"And scape forth, since liberty is lever.",renaissance
Therefore farewell; go trouble younger hearts,renaissance
And in me claim no more authority.,renaissance
With idle youth go use thy property,renaissance
"And thereon spend thy many brittle darts,",renaissance
"For hitherto though I have lost all my time,",renaissance
Me lusteth no lenger rotten boughs to climb.,renaissance
"Follow thy fair sun, unhappy shadow,",renaissance
Though thou be black as night,renaissance
"And she made all of light,",renaissance
Yet follow thy fair sun unhappy shadow.,renaissance
"Follow her whose light thy light depriveth,",renaissance
"Though here thou livst disgraced,",renaissance
"And she in heaven is placed,",renaissance
Yet follow her whose light the world reviveth.,renaissance
"Follow those pure beams whose beauty burneth,",renaissance
"That so have scorched thee,",renaissance
"As thou still black must be,",renaissance
Till Her kind beams thy black to brightness turneth.,renaissance
"Follow her while yet her glory shineth,",renaissance
"There comes a luckless night,",renaissance
"That will dim all her light,",renaissance
And this the black unhappy shade divineth.,renaissance
"Follow still since so thy fates ordained,",renaissance
"The Sun must have his shade,",renaissance
"Till both at once do fade,",renaissance
"The Sun still proved, the shadow still disdained.",renaissance
"Follow your saint, follow with accents sweet;",renaissance
"Haste you, sad notes, fall at her flying feet.",renaissance
"There, wrapp'd in cloud of sorrow, pity move,",renaissance
And tell the ravisher of my soul I perish for her love:,renaissance
"But if she scorns my never-ceasing pain,",renaissance
Then burst with sighing in her sight and ne'er return again.,renaissance
"All that I sung still to her praise did tend,",renaissance
Still she was first; still she my songs did end;,renaissance
"Yet she my love and music both doth fly,",renaissance
The music that her echo is and beauty's sympathy.,renaissance
Then let my notes pursue her scornful flight:,renaissance
It shall suffice that they were breath'd and died for her delight.,renaissance
Forget not yet the tried intent,renaissance
Of such a truth as I have meant;,renaissance
"My great travail so gladly spent,",renaissance
            Forget not yet.,renaissance
   Forget not yet when first began,renaissance
"The weary life ye know, since whan",renaissance
"The suit, the service, none tell can;",renaissance
            Forget not yet.,renaissance
"   Forget not yet the great assays,",renaissance
"The cruel wrong, the scornful ways;",renaissance
"The painful patience in denays,",renaissance
            Forget not yet.,renaissance
"   Forget not yet, forget not this,",renaissance
How long ago hath been and is,renaissance
The mind that never meant amiss;,renaissance
            Forget not yet.,renaissance
"   Forget not then thine own approved,",renaissance
"The which so long hath thee so loved,",renaissance
Whose steadfast faith yet never moved;,renaissance
            Forget not this.,renaissance
"            Whoever comes to shroud me, do not harm",renaissance
         Nor question much,renaissance
"That subtle wreath of hair, which crowns my arm;",renaissance
"The mystery, the sign, you must not touch,",renaissance
"         For 'tis my outward soul,",renaissance
"Viceroy to that, which then to heaven being gone,",renaissance
         Will leave this to control,renaissance
"And keep these limbs, her provinces, from dissolution.",renaissance
For if the sinewy thread my brain lets fall,renaissance
         Through every part,renaissance
"Can tie those parts, and make me one of all,",renaissance
"Those hairs which upward grew, and strength and art",renaissance
"         Have from a better brain,",renaissance
Can better do'it; except she meant that I,renaissance
"         By this should know my pain,",renaissance
"As prisoners then are manacled, when they'are condemn'd to die.",renaissance
"Whate'er she meant by'it, bury it with me,",renaissance
         For since I am,renaissance
"Love's martyr, it might breed idolatry,",renaissance
If into other hands these relics came;,renaissance
         As 'twas humility,renaissance
"To afford to it all that a soul can do,",renaissance
"         So, 'tis some bravery,",renaissance
"That since you would have none of me, I bury some of you.",renaissance
"I wonder, by my troth, what thou and I",renaissance
"Did, till we loved? Were we not weaned till then?",renaissance
"But sucked on country pleasures, childishly?",renaissance
Or snorted we in the Seven Sleepers den?,renaissance
"Twas so; but this, all pleasures fancies be.",renaissance
"If ever any beauty I did see,",renaissance

"Whatever dies, was not mixed equally;",renaissance
"If our two loves be one, or, thou and I",renaissance
"Love so alike, that none do slacken, none can die.",renaissance
The heart and service to you proffer'd,renaissance
"With right good will full honestly,",renaissance
"Refuse it not, since it is offer'd,",renaissance
But take it to you gentlely.,renaissance
"And though it be a small present,",renaissance
"Yet good, consider graciously",renaissance
"The thought, the mind, and the intent",renaissance
Of him that loves you faithfully.,renaissance
It were a thing of small effect,renaissance
"To work my woe thus cruelly,",renaissance
For my good will to be abject:,renaissance
Therefore accept it lovingly.,renaissance
"Pain or travel, to run or ride,",renaissance
I undertake it pleasantly;,renaissance

"The one Abydos, the other Sestos hight.",renaissance
"At Sestos Hero dwelt; Hero the fair,",renaissance
"Whom young Apollo courted for her hair,",renaissance
"And offer'd as a dower his burning throne,",renaissance
Where she could sit for men to gaze upon.,renaissance
"The outside of her garments were of lawn,",renaissance
"The lining purple silk, with gilt stars drawn;",renaissance
"Her wide sleeves green, and border'd with a grove,",renaissance
Where Venus in her naked glory strove,renaissance
To please the careless and disdainful eyes,renaissance
"Of proud Adonis, that before her lies;",renaissance
"Her kirtle blue, whereon was many a stain,",renaissance
Made with the blood of wretched lovers slain.,renaissance
"Upon her head she ware a myrtle wreath,",renaissance
From whence her veil reach'd to the ground beneath;,renaissance
"Her veil was artificial flowers and leaves,",renaissance
Whose workmanship both man and beast deceives;,renaissance
"Many would praise the sweet smell as she past,",renaissance
When 'twas the odour which her breath forth cast;,renaissance
"And there for honey bees have sought in vain,",renaissance
"And beat from thence, have lighted there again.",renaissance
"About her neck hung chains of pebble-stone,",renaissance
"Which lighten'd by her neck, like diamonds shone.",renaissance
She ware no gloves; for neither sun nor wind,renaissance
"Would burn or parch her hands, but, to her mind,",renaissance
"Or warm or cool them, for they took delight",renaissance
"To play upon those hands, they were so white.",renaissance
"Buskins of shells, all silver'd, used she,",renaissance
And branch'd with blushing coral to the knee;,renaissance
"Where sparrows perch'd, of hollow pearl and gold,",renaissance
Such as the world would wonder to behold:,renaissance
"Those with sweet water oft her handmaid fills,",renaissance
"Which as she went, would chirrup through the bills.",renaissance
"Some say, for her the fairest Cupid pin'd,",renaissance
"And looking in her face, was strooken blind.",renaissance
"But this is true; so like was one the other,",renaissance
As he imagin'd Hero was his mother;,renaissance
"And oftentimes into her bosom flew,",renaissance
"About her naked neck his bare arms threw,",renaissance
"And laid his childish head upon her breast,",renaissance
And with still panting rock'd there took his rest.,renaissance
"So lovely-fair was Hero, Venus' nun,",renaissance
"As Nature wept, thinking she was undone,",renaissance
"Because she took more from her than she left,",renaissance
And of such wondrous beauty her bereft:,renaissance
"Therefore, in sign her treasure suffer'd wrack,",renaissance
Since Hero's time hath half the world been black.,renaissance
"         Amorous Leander, beautiful and young",renaissance

Fair Cynthia wish'd his arms might be her sphere;,renaissance

His body was as straight as Circe's wand;,renaissance
Jove might have sipt out nectar from his hand.,renaissance
"Even as delicious meat is to the taste,",renaissance
"So was his neck in touching, and surpast",renaissance
"The white of Pelops' shoulder: I could tell ye,",renaissance
"How smooth his breast was, and how white his belly;",renaissance
And whose immortal fingers did imprint,renaissance
That heavenly path with many a curious dint,renaissance
That runs along his back; but my rude pen,renaissance
"Can hardly blazon forth the loves of men,",renaissance
Much less of powerful gods: let it suffice,renaissance
That my slack Muse sings of Leander's eyes;,renaissance
"Those orient cheeks and lips, exceeding his",renaissance
That leapt into the water for a kiss,renaissance
"Of his own shadow, and, despising many,",renaissance
Died ere he could enjoy the love of any.,renaissance
"Had wild Hippolytus Leander seen,",renaissance
Enamour'd of his beauty had he been.,renaissance
"His presence made the rudest peasant melt,",renaissance
That in the vast uplandish country dwelt;,renaissance
"The barbarous Thracian soldier, mov'd with nought,",renaissance
"Was mov'd with him, and for his favour sought.",renaissance
"Some swore he was a maid in man's attire,",renaissance
"For in his looks were all that men desire,",renaissance
"A pleasant smiling cheek, a speaking eye,",renaissance
A brow for love to banquet royally;,renaissance
"And such as knew he was a man, would say,",renaissance
"Leander, thou art made for amorous play;
Why art thou not in love, and lov'd of all?
Though thou be fair, yet be not thine own thrall.",renaissance
"         The men of wealthy Sestos every year,",renaissance
"For his sake whom their goddess held so dear,",renaissance
"Rose-cheek'd Adonis, kept a solemn feast.",renaissance
Thither resorted many a wandering guest,renaissance
To meet their loves; such as had none at all,renaissance
Came lovers home from this great festival;,renaissance
"For every street, like to a firmament,",renaissance
"Glister'd with breathing stars, who, where they went,",renaissance
"Frighted the melancholy earth, which deem'd",renaissance
"Eternal heaven to burn, for so it seem'd",renaissance
"As if another Pha{""e}ton had got",renaissance
The guidance of the sun's rich chariot.,renaissance
"But far above the loveliest, Hero shin'd,",renaissance
And stole away th' enchanted gazer's mind;,renaissance
"For like sea-nymphs' inveigling harmony,",renaissance
So was her beauty to the standers-by;,renaissance
"Nor that night-wandering, pale, and watery star",renaissance
(When yawning dragons draw her thirling car,renaissance
"From Latmus' mount up to the gloomy sky,",renaissance
"Where, crown'd with blazing light and majesty,",renaissance
She proudly sits) more over-rules the flood,renaissance
Than she the hearts of those that near her stood.,renaissance
"Even as when gaudy nymphs pursue the chase,",renaissance
"Wretched Ixion's shaggy-footed race,",renaissance
"Incens'd with savage heat, gallop amain",renaissance
"From steep pine-bearing mountains to the plain,",renaissance
"So ran the people forth to gaze upon her,",renaissance
And all that view'd her were enamour'd on her.,renaissance
"And as in fury of a dreadful fight,",renaissance
"Their fellows being slain or put to flight,",renaissance
"Poor soldiers stand with fear of death dead-strooken,",renaissance
"So at her presence all surpris'd and tooken,",renaissance
Await the sentence of her scornful eyes;,renaissance
He whom she favours lives; the other dies.,renaissance
"There might you see one sigh, another rage,",renaissance
"And some, their violent passions to assuage,",renaissance
"Compile sharp satires; but, alas, too late,",renaissance
For faithful love will never turn to hate.,renaissance
"And many, seeing great princes were denied,",renaissance
"Pin'd as they went, and thinking on her, died.",renaissance
On this feast-dayO cursed day and hour!,renaissance
"Went Hero thorough Sestos, from her tower",renaissance
"To Venus' temple, where unhappily,",renaissance
"As after chanc'd, they did each other spy.",renaissance
So fair a church as this had Venus none:,renaissance
"The walls were of discolour'd jasper-stone,",renaissance
Wherein was Proteus carved; and over-head,renaissance
"A lively vine of green sea-agate spread,",renaissance
"Where by one hand light-headed Bacchus hung,",renaissance
And with the other wine from grapes out-wrung.,renaissance
Of crystal shining fair the pavement was;,renaissance
The town of Sestos call'd it Venus' glass:,renaissance
"There might you see the gods in sundry shapes,",renaissance
"Committing heady riots, incest, rapes:",renaissance
"For know, that underneath this radiant flower",renaissance
"Was Danae's statue in a brazen tower,",renaissance
"Jove slyly stealing from his sister's bed,",renaissance
"To dally with Idalian Ganimed,",renaissance
"And for his love Europa bellowing loud,",renaissance
And tumbling with the rainbow in a cloud;,renaissance
"Blood-quaffing Mars heaving the iron net,",renaissance
Which limping Vulcan and his Cyclops set;,renaissance
"Love kindling fire, to burn such towns as Troy,",renaissance
Sylvanus weeping for the lovely boy,renaissance
"That now is turn'd into a cypress tree,",renaissance
Under whose shade the wood-gods love to be.,renaissance
And in the midst a silver altar stood:,renaissance
"There Hero, sacrificing turtles' blood,",renaissance
"Vail'd to the ground, veiling her eyelids close;",renaissance
And modestly they opened as she rose.,renaissance
Thence flew Love's arrow with the golden head;,renaissance
And thus Leander was enamoured.,renaissance
"Stone-still he stood, and evermore he gazed,",renaissance
Till with the fire that from his count'nance blazed,renaissance
Relenting Hero's gentle heart was strook:,renaissance
Such force and virtue hath an amorous look.,renaissance
"         It lies not in our power to love or hate,",renaissance
For will in us is over-rul'd by fate.,renaissance
"When two are stript, long ere the course begin,",renaissance
"We wish that one should lose, the other win;",renaissance
And one especially do we affect,renaissance
"Of two gold ingots, like in each respect:",renaissance
"The reason no man knows, let it suffice,",renaissance
What we behold is censur'd by our eyes.,renaissance
"Where both deliberate, the love is slight:",renaissance
"Who ever lov'd, that lov'd not at first sight?",renaissance
"Show me dear Christ, thy spouse so bright and clear.",renaissance
What! is it she which on the other shore,renaissance
"Goes richly painted? or which, robb'd and tore,",renaissance
Laments and mourns in Germany and here?,renaissance
"Sleeps she a thousand, then peeps up one year?",renaissance
"Is she self-truth, and errs? now new, now outwore?",renaissance
"Doth she, and did she, and shall she evermore",renaissance
"On one, on seven, or on no hill appear?",renaissance
"Dwells she with us, or like adventuring knights",renaissance
"First travel we to seek, and then make love?",renaissance
"Betray, kind husband, thy spouse to our sights,",renaissance
"And let mine amorous soul court thy mild Dove,",renaissance
Who is most true and pleasing to thee then,renaissance
When she'is embrac'd and open to most men.,renaissance
Since she whom I lov'd hath paid her last debt,renaissance
"To nature, and to hers, and my good is dead,",renaissance
"And her soul early into heaven ravished,",renaissance
Wholly in heavenly things my mind is set.,renaissance
Here the admiring her my mind did whet,renaissance
"To seek thee, God; so streams do show the head;",renaissance
"But though I have found thee, and thou my thirst hast fed,",renaissance
A holy thirsty dropsy melts me yet.,renaissance
"But why should I beg more love, whenas thou",renaissance
"Dost woo my soul, for hers off'ring all thine,",renaissance
And dost not only fear lest I allow,renaissance
"My love to saints and angels, things divine,",renaissance
But in thy tender jealousy dost doubt,renaissance
"Lest the world, flesh, yea devil put thee out.",renaissance
"I find no peace, and all my war is done.",renaissance
I fear and hope. I burn and freeze like ice.,renaissance
"I fly above the wind, yet can I not arise;",renaissance
"And nought I have, and all the world I season.",renaissance
That loseth nor locketh holdeth me in prison,renaissance
And holdeth me notyet can I scape no wise,renaissance
"Nor letteth me live nor die at my device,",renaissance
And yet of death it giveth me occasion.,renaissance
"Without eyen I see, and without tongue I plain.",renaissance
"I desire to perish, and yet I ask health.",renaissance
"I love another, and thus I hate myself.",renaissance
I feed me in sorrow and laugh in all my pain;,renaissance
"Likewise displeaseth me both life and death,",renaissance
And my delight is causer of this strife.,renaissance
"Unhappy verse, the witness of my unhappy state,",renaissance
Make thy self flutt'ring wings of thy fast flying,renaissance
"Thought, and fly forth unto my love, wheresoever she be:",renaissance
"Whether lying restless in heavy bed, or else",renaissance
"Sitting so cheerless at the cheerful board, or else",renaissance
Playing alone careless on her heavenly virginals.,renaissance
"If in bed, tell her, that my eyes can take no rest:",renaissance
"If at board, tell her, that my mouth can eat no meat:",renaissance
"If at her virginals, tell her, I can hear no mirth.",renaissance
Asked why? say: waking love suffereth no sleep:,renaissance
Say that raging love doth appal the weak stomach:,renaissance
"Say, that lamenting love marreth the musical.",renaissance
"Tell her, that her pleasures were wont to lull me asleep:",renaissance
"Tell her, that her beauty was wont to feed mine eyes:",renaissance
"Tell her, that her sweet tongue was wont to make me mirth.",renaissance
"Now do I nightly waste, wanting my kindly rest:",renaissance
"Now do I daily starve, wanting my lively food:",renaissance
"Now do I always die, wanting thy timely mirth.",renaissance
"And if I waste, who will bewail my heavy chance?",renaissance
"And if I starve, who will record my cursed end?",renaissance
"And if I die, who will say: ""This was Immerito""?",renaissance
"I can love both fair and brown,",renaissance
"Her whom abundance melts, and her whom want betrays,",renaissance
"Her who loves loneness best, and her who masks and plays,",renaissance
"Her whom the country formed, and whom the town,",renaissance
"Her who believes, and her who tries,",renaissance
"Her who still weeps with spongy eyes,",renaissance
"And her who is dry cork, and never cries;",renaissance
"I can love her, and her, and you, and you,",renaissance
"I can love any, so she be not true.",renaissance
Will no other vice content you?,renaissance
Will it not serve your turn to do as did your mothers?,renaissance
"Or have you all old vices spent, and now would find out others?",renaissance
Or doth a fear that men are true torment you?,renaissance
"O we are not, be not you so;",renaissance
"Let me, and do you, twenty know.",renaissance
"Rob me, but bind me not, and let me go.",renaissance
"Must I, who came to travail thorough you,",renaissance
"Grow your fixed subject, because you are true?",renaissance
"Venus heard me sigh this song,",renaissance
"And by love's sweetest part, variety, she swore,",renaissance
She heard not this till now; and that it should be so no more.,renaissance
"She went, examined, and returned ere long,",renaissance
"And said, Alas! some two or three",renaissance
"Poor heretics in love there be,",renaissance
Which think to stablish dangerous constancy.,renaissance
"But I have told them, Since you will be true,",renaissance
You shall be true to them who are false to you.,renaissance
"Leave me, O Love, which reachest but to dust;",renaissance
"And thou, my mind, aspire to higher things;",renaissance
Grow rich in that which never taketh rust;,renaissance
Whatever fades but fading pleasure brings.,renaissance
Draw in thy beams and humble all thy might,renaissance
To that sweet yoke where lasting freedoms be;,renaissance
"Which breaks the clouds and opens forth the light,",renaissance
That both doth shine and give us sight to see.,renaissance
O take fast hold; let that light be thy guide,renaissance
"In this small course which birth draws out to death,",renaissance
"And think how evil becometh him to slide,",renaissance
"Who seeketh heav'n, and comes of heav'nly breath.",renaissance
"Then farewell, world; thy uttermost I see:",renaissance
"Eternal Love, maintain thy life in me.",renaissance
"Stand still, and I will read to thee",renaissance
"A lecture, love, in love's philosophy.",renaissance
"         These three hours that we have spent,",renaissance
"         Walking here, two shadows went",renaissance
"Along with us, which we ourselves produc'd.",renaissance
"But, now the sun is just above our head,",renaissance
"         We do those shadows tread,",renaissance
         And to brave clearness all things are reduc'd.,renaissance
"So whilst our infant loves did grow,",renaissance
"Disguises did, and shadows, flow",renaissance
"From us, and our cares; but now 'tis not so.",renaissance
"That love has not attain'd the high'st degree,",renaissance
Which is still diligent lest others see.,renaissance
"Except our loves at this noon stay,",renaissance
We shall new shadows make the other way.,renaissance
         As the first were made to blind,renaissance
"         Others, these which come behind",renaissance
"Will work upon ourselves, and blind our eyes.",renaissance
"If our loves faint, and westwardly decline,",renaissance
"         To me thou, falsely, thine,",renaissance
         And I to thee mine actions shall disguise.,renaissance
"The morning shadows wear away,",renaissance
But these grow longer all the day;,renaissance
"But oh, love's day is short, if love decay.",renaissance
"Love is a growing, or full constant light,",renaissance
"And his first minute, after noon, is night.",renaissance
The longe love that in my thought doth harbour,renaissance
"And in mine hert doth keep his residence,",renaissance
Into my face presseth with bold pretence,renaissance
"And therein campeth, spreading his banner.",renaissance
She that me learneth to love and suffer,renaissance
And will that my trust and lustes negligence,renaissance
"Be rayned by reason, shame, and reverence,",renaissance
With his hardiness taketh displeasure.,renaissance
"Wherewithall unto the hert's forest he fleeth,",renaissance
"Leaving his enterprise with pain and cry,",renaissance
And there him hideth and not appeareth.,renaissance
What may I do when my master feareth,renaissance
But in the field with him to live and die?,renaissance
For good is the life ending faithfully.,renaissance
"Some that have deeper digg'd love's mine than I,",renaissance
"Say, where his centric happiness doth lie;",renaissance
"         I have lov'd, and got, and told,",renaissance
"But should I love, get, tell, till I were old,",renaissance
I should not find that hidden mystery.,renaissance
"         Oh, 'tis imposture all!",renaissance
"And as no chemic yet th'elixir got,",renaissance
         But glorifies his pregnant pot,renaissance
         If by the way to him befall,renaissance
"Some odoriferous thing, or medicinal,",renaissance
"         So, lovers dream a rich and long delight,",renaissance
         But get a winter-seeming summer's night.,renaissance
"Our ease, our thrift, our honour, and our day,",renaissance
Shall we for this vain bubble's shadow pay?,renaissance
"         Ends love in this, that my man",renaissance
"Can be as happy'as I can, if he can",renaissance
Endure the short scorn of a bridegroom's play?,renaissance
         That loving wretch that swears,renaissance
"'Tis not the bodies marry, but the minds,",renaissance
"         Which he in her angelic finds,",renaissance
"         Would swear as justly that he hears,",renaissance
"In that day's rude hoarse minstrelsy, the spheres.",renaissance
         Hope not for mind in women; at their best,renaissance
"         Sweetness and wit, they'are but mummy, possess'd.",renaissance
"         I long to talk with some old lover's ghost,",renaissance
      Who died before the god of love was born.,renaissance
"I cannot think that he, who then lov'd most,",renaissance
      Sunk so low as to love one which did scorn.,renaissance
"But since this god produc'd a destiny,",renaissance
"And that vice-nature, custom, lets it be,",renaissance
"      I must love her, that loves not me.",renaissance
"   Sure, they which made him god, meant not so much,",renaissance
      Nor he in his young godhead practis'd it.,renaissance
"But when an even flame two hearts did touch,",renaissance
      His office was indulgently to fit,renaissance
Actives to passives. Correspondency,renaissance
Only his subject was; it cannot be,renaissance
"      Love, till I love her, that loves me.",renaissance
   But every modern god will now extend,renaissance
      His vast prerogative as far as Jove.,renaissance
"To rage, to lust, to write to, to commend,",renaissance
      All is the purlieu of the god of love.,renaissance
O! were we waken'd by this tyranny,renaissance
"To ungod this child again, it could not be",renaissance
"      I should love her, who loves not me.",renaissance
"   Rebel and atheist too, why murmur I,",renaissance
      As though I felt the worst that love could do?,renaissance
"Love might make me leave loving, or might try",renaissance
"      A deeper plague, to make her love me too;",renaissance
"Which, since she loves before, I'am loth to see.",renaissance
"Falsehood is worse than hate; and that must be,",renaissance
"      If she whom I love, should love me.",renaissance
"      If yet I have not all thy love,",renaissance
"Dear, I shall never have it all;",renaissance
"I cannot breathe one other sigh, to move,",renaissance
Nor can intreat one other tear to fall;,renaissance
"And all my treasure, which should purchase thee",renaissance
"Sighs, tears, and oaths, and lettersI have spent.",renaissance
"Yet no more can be due to me,",renaissance
Than at the bargain made was meant;,renaissance
"If then thy gift of love were partial,",renaissance
"That some to me, some should to others fall,",renaissance
"         Dear, I shall never have thee all.",renaissance
"Or if then thou gavest me all,",renaissance
"All was but all, which thou hadst then;",renaissance
"But if in thy heart, since, there be or shall",renaissance
"New love created be, by other men,",renaissance
"Which have their stocks entire, and can in tears,",renaissance
"In sighs, in oaths, and letters, outbid me,",renaissance
"This new love may beget new fears,",renaissance
For this love was not vow'd by thee.,renaissance
"And yet it was, thy gift being general;",renaissance
"The ground, thy heart, is mine; whatever shall",renaissance
"         Grow there, dear, I should have it all.",renaissance
"Yet I would not have all yet,",renaissance
He that hath all can have no more;,renaissance
And since my love doth every day admit,renaissance
"New growth, thou shouldst have new rewards in store;",renaissance
"Thou canst not every day give me thy heart,",renaissance
"If thou canst give it, then thou never gavest it;",renaissance
"Love's riddles are, that though thy heart depart,",renaissance
"It stays at home, and thou with losing savest it;",renaissance
"But we will have a way more liberal,",renaissance
"Than changing hearts, to join them; so we shall",renaissance
"         Be one, and one another's all.",renaissance
"         Madam, withouten many words",renaissance
    Once I am sure ye will or no ...,renaissance
"And if ye will, then leave your bourds",renaissance
"    And use your wit and show it so,",renaissance
And with a beck ye shall me call;,renaissance
    And if of one that burneth alway,renaissance
"Ye have any pity at all,",renaissance
    Answer him fair with & {.} or nay.,renaissance
"If it be &, {.} I shall be fain;",renaissance
"    If it be nay, friends as before;",renaissance
"Ye shall another man obtain,",renaissance
    And I mine own and yours no more.,renaissance
    My lute awake! perform the last,renaissance
"Labour that thou and I shall waste,",renaissance
And end that I have now begun;,renaissance
"For when this song is sung and past,",renaissance
"My lute be still, for I have done.",renaissance
"As to be heard where ear is none,",renaissance
"As lead to grave in marble stone,",renaissance
My song may pierce her heart as soon;,renaissance
Should we then sigh or sing or moan?,renaissance
"No, no, my lute, for I have done.",renaissance
The rocks do not so cruelly,renaissance
"Repulse the waves continually,",renaissance
As she my suit and affection;,renaissance
"So that I am past remedy,",renaissance
Whereby my lute and I have done.,renaissance
Proud of the spoil that thou hast got,renaissance
"Of simple hearts thorough Love's shot,",renaissance
"By whom, unkind, thou hast them won,",renaissance
"Think not he hath his bow forgot,",renaissance
Although my lute and I have done.,renaissance
Vengeance shall fall on thy disdain,renaissance
That makest but game on earnest pain.,renaissance
Think not alone under the sun,renaissance
"Unquit to cause thy lovers plain,",renaissance
Although my lute and I have done.,renaissance
Perchance thee lie wethered and old,renaissance
"The winter nights that are so cold,",renaissance
Plaining in vain unto the moon;,renaissance
Thy wishes then dare not be told;,renaissance
"Care then who list, for I have done.",renaissance
And then may chance thee to repent,renaissance
The time that thou hast lost and spent,renaissance
To cause thy lovers sigh and swoon;,renaissance
"Then shalt thou know beauty but lent,",renaissance
And wish and want as I have done.,renaissance
"Now cease, my lute; this is the last",renaissance
"Labour that thou and I shall waste,",renaissance
And ended is that we begun.,renaissance
Now is this song both sung and past:,renaissance
"My lute be still, for I have done.",renaissance
"I now think Love is rather deaf than blind,",renaissance
For else it could not be,renaissance
"That she,",renaissance
"Whom I adore so much, should so slight me",renaissance
And cast my love behind.,renaissance
"I'm sure my language to her was as sweet,",renaissance
And every close did meet,renaissance
"In sentence of as subtle feet,",renaissance
As hath the youngest He,renaissance
That sits in shadow of Apollo's tree.,renaissance
"O, but my conscious fears,",renaissance
"That fly my thoughts between,",renaissance
Tell me that she hath seen,renaissance
"My hundred of gray hairs,",renaissance
Told seven and forty years,renaissance
"Read so much waste, as she cannot embrace",renaissance
My mountain belly and my rocky face;,renaissance
And all these through her eyes have stopp'd her ears.,renaissance
"Come live with me and be my love,",renaissance
"And we will all the pleasures prove,",renaissance
"That Valleys, groves, hills, and fields,",renaissance
"Woods, or steepy mountain yields.",renaissance
"And we will sit upon the Rocks,",renaissance
"Seeing the Shepherds feed their flocks,",renaissance
By shallow Rivers to whose falls,renaissance
Melodious birds sing Madrigals.,renaissance
And I will make thee beds of Roses,renaissance
"And a thousand fragrant posies,",renaissance
"A cap of flowers, and a kirtle",renaissance
Embroidered all with leaves of Myrtle;,renaissance
A gown made of the finest wool,renaissance
Which from our pretty Lambs we pull;,renaissance
"Fair lined slippers for the cold,",renaissance
With buckles of the purest gold;,renaissance
"A belt of straw and Ivy buds,",renaissance
With Coral clasps and Amber studs:,renaissance
"And if these pleasures may thee move,",renaissance
"Come live with me, and be my love.",renaissance
The Shepherds Swains shall dance and sing,renaissance
For thy delight each May-morning:,renaissance
"If these delights thy mind may move,",renaissance
"Then live with me, and be my love.",renaissance
When my grave is broke up again,renaissance
"       Some second guest to entertain,",renaissance
"       (For graves have learn'd that woman head,",renaissance
       To be to more than one a bed),renaissance
"                And he that digs it, spies",renaissance
"A bracelet of bright hair about the bone,",renaissance
"                Will he not let'us alone,",renaissance
"And think that there a loving couple lies,",renaissance
Who thought that this device might be some way,renaissance
"To make their souls, at the last busy day,",renaissance
"Meet at this grave, and make a little stay?",renaissance
"         If this fall in a time, or land,",renaissance
"         Where mis-devotion doth command,",renaissance
"         Then he, that digs us up, will bring",renaissance
"         Us to the bishop, and the king,",renaissance
                To make us relics; then,renaissance
"Thou shalt be a Mary Magdalen, and I",renaissance
                A something else thereby;,renaissance
"All women shall adore us, and some men;",renaissance
"And since at such time miracles are sought,",renaissance
I would have that age by this paper taught,renaissance
What miracles we harmless lovers wrought.,renaissance
"         First, we lov'd well and faithfully,",renaissance
"         Yet knew not what we lov'd, nor why;",renaissance
         Difference of sex no more we knew,renaissance
         Than our guardian angels do;,renaissance
"                Coming and going, we",renaissance
"Perchance might kiss, but not between those meals;",renaissance
                Our hands ne'er touch'd the seals,renaissance
"Which nature, injur'd by late law, sets free;",renaissance
"These miracles we did, but now alas,",renaissance
"All measure, and all language, I should pass,",renaissance
Should I tell what a miracle she was.,renaissance
"Ring out your bells, let mourning shows be spread;",renaissance
For Love is dead,renaissance
"All love is dead, infected",renaissance
With plague of deep disdain;,renaissance
"Worth, as nought worth, rejected,",renaissance
And Faith fair scorn doth gain.,renaissance
"From so ungrateful fancy,",renaissance
"From such a female franzy,",renaissance
"From them that use men thus,",renaissance
"Good Lord, deliver us!",renaissance
"Weep, neighbours, weep; do you not hear it said",renaissance
That Love is dead?,renaissance
"His death-bed, peacock's folly;",renaissance
His winding-sheet is shame;,renaissance
"His will, false-seeming holy;",renaissance
"His sole exec'tor, blame.",renaissance
"From so ungrateful fancy,",renaissance
"From such a female franzy,",renaissance
"From them that use men thus,",renaissance
"Good Lord, deliver us!",renaissance
"Let dirge be sung and trentals rightly read,",renaissance
For Love is dead;,renaissance
Sir Wrong his tomb ordaineth,renaissance
"My mistress' marble heart,",renaissance
"Which epitaph containeth,",renaissance
Her eyes were once his dart.,renaissance
"From so ungrateful fancy,",renaissance
"From such a female franzy,",renaissance
"From them that use men thus,",renaissance
"Good Lord, deliver us!",renaissance
"Alas, I lie, rage hath this error bred;",renaissance
Love is not dead;,renaissance
"Love is not dead, but sleepeth",renaissance
"In her unmatched mind,",renaissance
"Where she his counsel keepeth,",renaissance
Till due desert she find.,renaissance
"Therefore from so vile fancy,",renaissance
"To call such wit a franzy,",renaissance
"Who Love can temper thus,",renaissance
"Good Lord, deliver us!Rose-cheek'd Laura, come,",renaissance
Sing thou smoothly with thy beauty's,renaissance
"Silent music, either other",renaissance
Sweetly gracing.,renaissance
Lovely forms do flow,renaissance
From concent divinely framed;,renaissance
"Heav'n is music, and thy beauty's",renaissance
Birth is heavenly.,renaissance
These dull notes we sing,renaissance
Discords need for helps to grace them;,renaissance
Only beauty purely loving,renaissance
"Knows no discord,",renaissance
"But still moves delight,",renaissance
"Like clear springs renew'd by flowing,",renaissance
"Ever perfect, ever in them-",renaissance
"Selves eternal.Since so ye please to hear me plain,",renaissance
"And that ye do rejoice my smart,",renaissance
Me list no lenger to remain,renaissance
To such as be so overthwart.,renaissance
But cursed be that cruel heart,renaissance
Which hath procurd a careless mind,renaissance
"For me and mine unfeigned smart,",renaissance
And forceth me such faults to find.,renaissance
More than too much I am assured,renaissance
"Of thine intent, whereto to trust;",renaissance
"A speedless proof I have endured,",renaissance
And now I leave it to them that lust.,renaissance
"My true-love hath my heart and I have his,",renaissance
By just exchange one for the other given:,renaissance
"I hold his dear, and mine he cannot miss;",renaissance
There never was a bargain better driven.,renaissance
His heart in me keeps me and him in one;,renaissance
My heart in him his thoughts and senses guides:,renaissance
"He loves my heart, for once it was his own;",renaissance
I cherish his because in me it bides.,renaissance
His heart his wound received from my sight;,renaissance
My heart was wounded with his wounded heart;,renaissance
"For as from me on him his hurt did light,",renaissance
"So still, methought, in me his hurt did smart:",renaissance
"Both equal hurt, in this change sought our bliss,",renaissance
My true love hath my heart and I have his.,renaissance
"Go and catch a falling star,",renaissance
"    Get with child a mandrake root,",renaissance
"Tell me where all past years are,",renaissance
"    Or who cleft the devil's foot,",renaissance
"Teach me to hear mermaids singing,",renaissance
"Or to keep off envy's stinging,",renaissance
            And find,renaissance
            What wind,renaissance
Serves to advance an honest mind.,renaissance
"If thou be'st born to strange sights,",renaissance
"    Things invisible to see,",renaissance
"Ride ten thousand days and nights,",renaissance
"    Till age snow white hairs on thee,",renaissance
"Thou, when thou return'st, wilt tell me,",renaissance
"All strange wonders that befell thee,",renaissance
"            And swear,",renaissance
            No where,renaissance
"Lives a woman true, and fair.",renaissance
"If thou find'st one, let me know,",renaissance
    Such a pilgrimage were sweet;,renaissance
"Yet do not, I would not go,",renaissance
    Though at next door we might meet;,renaissance
"Though she were true, when you met her,",renaissance
"And last, till you write your letter,",renaissance
            Yet she,renaissance
            Will be,renaissance
"False, ere I come, to two, or three.",renaissance
The student may give either title during the recitation.,renaissance
O Mistress mine where are you roaming?,renaissance
"O stay and hear, your true love's coming,",renaissance
      That can sing both high and low.,renaissance
Trip no further pretty sweeting.,renaissance
"Journeys end in lovers' meeting,",renaissance
      Every wise man's son doth know.,renaissance
"What is love, 'tis not hereafter,",renaissance
"Present mirth, hath present laughter:",renaissance
"      What's to come, is still unsure.",renaissance
"In delay there lies no plenty,",renaissance
Then come kiss me sweet and twenty:,renaissance
      Youth's a stuff will not endure.,renaissance
"      Sweetest love, I do not go,",renaissance
"         For weariness of thee,",renaissance
Nor in hope the world can show,renaissance
         A fitter love for me;,renaissance
                But since that I,renaissance
"Must die at last, 'tis best",renaissance
To use myself in jest,renaissance
         Thus by feign'd deaths to die.,renaissance
"Yesternight the sun went hence,",renaissance
         And yet is here today;,renaissance
"He hath no desire nor sense,",renaissance
         Nor half so short a way:,renaissance
"                Then fear not me,",renaissance
But believe that I shall make,renaissance
"Speedier journeys, since I take",renaissance
         More wings and spurs than he.,renaissance
"O how feeble is man's power,",renaissance
"         That if good fortune fall,",renaissance
"Cannot add another hour,",renaissance
         Nor a lost hour recall!,renaissance
"                But come bad chance,",renaissance
"And we join to'it our strength,",renaissance
"And we teach it art and length,",renaissance
         Itself o'er us to'advance.,renaissance
"When thou sigh'st, thou sigh'st not wind,",renaissance
         But sigh'st my soul away;,renaissance
"When thou weep'st, unkindly kind,",renaissance
         My life's blood doth decay.,renaissance
                It cannot be,renaissance
"That thou lov'st me, as thou say'st,",renaissance
"If in thine my life thou waste,",renaissance
         That art the best of me.,renaissance
Let not thy divining heart,renaissance
         Forethink me any ill;,renaissance
"Destiny may take thy part,",renaissance
         And may thy fears fulfil;,renaissance
                But think that we,renaissance
Are but turn'd aside to sleep;,renaissance
They who one another keep,renaissance
"         Alive, ne'er parted be.",renaissance
"         Take, oh take those lips away,",renaissance
"      That so sweetly were forsworn,",renaissance
"And those eyes: the breake of day,",renaissance
      Lights that do mislead the Morn;,renaissance
"But my kisses bring again, bring again,",renaissance
"Seals of love, but sealed in vain, sealed in vain.",renaissance
"Drink to me only with thine eyes,",renaissance
         And I will pledge with mine;,renaissance
"Or leave a kiss but in the cup,",renaissance
         And Ill not look for wine.,renaissance
The thirst that from the soul doth rise,renaissance
         Doth ask a drink divine;,renaissance
"But might I of Joves nectar sup,",renaissance
         I would not change for thine.,renaissance
"I sent thee late a rosy wreath,",renaissance
         Not so much honouring thee,renaissance
"As giving it a hope, that there",renaissance
         It could not withered be.,renaissance
"But thou thereon didst only breathe,",renaissance
         And sentst it back to me;,renaissance
"Since when it grows, and smells, I swear,",renaissance
"         Not of itself, but thee.",renaissance
         When I consider everything that grows,renaissance
"Holds in perfection but a little moment,",renaissance
That this huge stage presenteth nought but shows,renaissance
Whereon the stars in secret influence comment;,renaissance
"When I perceive that men as plants increase,",renaissance
"Cheered and check'd even by the selfsame sky,",renaissance
"Vaunt in their youthful sap, at height decrease,",renaissance
And wear their brave state out of memory;,renaissance
Then the conceit of this inconstant stay,renaissance
"Sets you most rich in youth before my sight,",renaissance
Where wasteful Time debateth with Decay,renaissance
To change your day of youth to sullied night;,renaissance
"And all in war with Time for love of you,",renaissance
"As he takes from you, I engraft you new.",renaissance
"Devouring Time, blunt thou the lion's paws,",renaissance
And make the earth devour her own sweet brood;,renaissance
"Pluck the keen teeth from the fierce tiger's jaws,",renaissance
And burn the long-liv'd Phoenix in her blood;,renaissance
"Make glad and sorry seasons as thou fleets,",renaissance
"And do whate'er thou wilt, swift-footed Time,",renaissance
To the wide world and all her fading sweets;,renaissance
But I forbid thee one more heinous crime:,renaissance
"O, carve not with the hours my love's fair brow,",renaissance
Nor draw no lines there with thine antique pen!,renaissance
Him in thy course untainted do allow,renaissance
For beauty's pattern to succeeding men.,renaissance
"Yet do thy worst, old Time! Despite thy wrong",renaissance
My love shall in my verse ever live young.,renaissance
Let those who are in favour with their stars,renaissance
"Of public honour and proud titles boast,",renaissance
"Whilst I, whom fortune of such triumph bars,",renaissance
Unlook'd for joy in that I honour most.,renaissance
Great princes' favourites their fair leaves spread,renaissance
"But as the marigold at the sun's eye,",renaissance
"And in themselves their pride lies buried,",renaissance
For at a frown they in their glory die.,renaissance
"The painful warrior famoused for fight,",renaissance
"After a thousand victories once foil'd,",renaissance
"Is from the book of honour razed quite,",renaissance
And all the rest forgot for which he toil'd:,renaissance
"Then happy I, that love and am beloved",renaissance
Where I may not remove nor be removed.,renaissance
"When, in disgrace with fortune and mens eyes,",renaissance
"I all alone beweep my outcast state,",renaissance
"And trouble deaf heaven with my bootless cries,",renaissance
"And look upon myself and curse my fate,",renaissance
"Wishing me like to one more rich in hope,",renaissance
"Featured like him, like him with friends possessed,",renaissance
"Desiring this mans art and that mans scope,",renaissance
With what I most enjoy contented least;,renaissance
"Yet in these thoughts myself almost despising,",renaissance
"Haply I think on thee, and then my state,",renaissance
(Like to the lark at break of day arising,renaissance
From sullen earth) sings hymns at heavens gate;,renaissance
       For thy sweet love remembered such wealth brings,renaissance
       That then I scorn to change my state with kings.,renaissance
       When to the sessions of sweet silent thought,renaissance
"I summon up remembrance of things past,",renaissance
"I sigh the lack of many a thing I sought,",renaissance
And with old woes new wail my dear time's waste:,renaissance
"Then can I drown an eye, unus'd to flow,",renaissance
"For precious friends hid in death's dateless night,",renaissance
"And weep afresh love's long since cancell'd woe,",renaissance
And moan th' expense of many a vanish'd sight;,renaissance
"Then can I grieve at grievances foregone,",renaissance
And heavily from woe to woe tell o'er,renaissance
"The sad account of fore-bemoaned moan,",renaissance
Which I new pay as if not paid before.,renaissance
"But if the while I think on thee, dear friend,",renaissance
"All losses are restor'd, and sorrows end.",renaissance
"If thou survive my well-contented day,",renaissance
"When that churl Death my bones with dust shall cover,",renaissance
And shalt by fortune once more re-survey,renaissance
"These poor rude lines of thy deceased lover,",renaissance
"Compare them with the bettering of the time,",renaissance
"And though they be outstripp'd by every pen,",renaissance
"Reserve them for my love, not for their rhyme,",renaissance
Exceeded by the height of happier men.,renaissance
O then vouchsafe me but this loving thought:,renaissance
"Had my friend's Muse grown with this growing age
A dearer birth than this his love had brought,
To march in ranks of better equipage:
But since he died and poets better prove,
Theirs for their style I'll read, his for his love.",renaissance
Full many a glorious morning have I seen,renaissance
"Flatter the mountain-tops with sovereign eye,",renaissance
"Kissing with golden face the meadows green,",renaissance
Gilding pale streams with heavenly alchemy;,renaissance
Anon permit the basest clouds to ride,renaissance
With ugly rack on his celestial face,renaissance
"And from the forlorn world his visage hide,",renaissance
Stealing unseen to west with this disgrace.,renaissance
Even so my sun one early morn did shine,renaissance
With all-triumphant splendour on my brow;,renaissance
"But out, alack! he was but one hour mine;",renaissance
The region cloud hath mask'd him from me now.,renaissance
Yet him for this my love no whit disdaineth;,renaissance
Suns of the world may stain when heaven's sun staineth.,renaissance
"What is your substance, whereof are you made,",renaissance
That millions of strange shadows on you tend?,renaissance
"Since every one hath, every one, one shade,",renaissance
"And you, but one, can every shadow lend.",renaissance
"Describe Adonis, and the counterfeit",renaissance
Is poorly imitated after you;,renaissance
"On Helen's cheek all art of beauty set,",renaissance
And you in Grecian tires are painted new.,renaissance
Speak of the spring and foison of the year:,renaissance
"The one doth shadow of your beauty show,",renaissance
The other as your bounty doth appear;,renaissance
And you in every blessed shape we know.,renaissance
"    In all external grace you have some part,",renaissance
"    But you like none, none you, for constant heart.",renaissance
    When I have seen by Time's fell hand defac'd,renaissance
The rich proud cost of outworn buried age;,renaissance
When sometime lofty towers I see down-ras'd,renaissance
And brass eternal slave to mortal rage;,renaissance
When I have seen the hungry ocean gain,renaissance
"Advantage on the kingdom of the shore,",renaissance
"And the firm soil win of the wat'ry main,",renaissance
Increasing store with loss and loss with store;,renaissance
"When I have seen such interchange of state,",renaissance
Or state itself confounded to decay;,renaissance
"Ruin hath taught me thus to ruminate,",renaissance
That Time will come and take my love away.,renaissance
"This thought is as a death, which cannot choose",renaissance
But weep to have that which it fears to lose.,renaissance
"Tir'd with all these, for restful death I cry,",renaissance
"As, to behold desert a beggar born,",renaissance
"And needy nothing trimm'd in jollity,",renaissance
"And purest faith unhappily forsworn,",renaissance
"And gilded honour shamefully misplac'd,",renaissance
"And maiden virtue rudely strumpeted,",renaissance
"And right perfection wrongfully disgrac'd,",renaissance
"And strength by limping sway disabled,",renaissance
"And art made tongue-tied by authority,",renaissance
"And folly, doctor-like, controlling skill,",renaissance
"And simple truth miscall'd simplicity,",renaissance
And captive good attending captain ill.,renaissance
"Tir'd with all these, from these would I be gone,",renaissance
"Save that, to die, I leave my love alone.",renaissance
No longer mourn for me when I am dead,renaissance
Than you shall hear the surly sullen bell,renaissance
Give warning to the world that I am fled,renaissance
From this vile world with vilest worms to dwell; ,renaissance
"Nay, if you read this line, remember not",renaissance
"The hand that writ it; for I love you so, ",renaissance
"That I in your sweet thoughts would be forgot, ",renaissance
If thinking on me then should make you woe.,renaissance
"O, if (I say) you look upon this verse, ",renaissance
"When I (perhaps) compounded am with clay,",renaissance
"Do not so much as my poor name rehearse,",renaissance
"But let your love even with my life decay,",renaissance
"Lest the wise world should look into your moan, ",renaissance
And mock you with me after I am gone.,renaissance
That time of year thou mayst in me behold,renaissance
"When yellow leaves, or none, or few, do hang",renaissance
"Upon those boughs which shake against the cold,",renaissance
"Bare ruin'd choirs, where late the sweet birds sang.",renaissance
In me thou see'st the twilight of such day,renaissance
"As after sunset fadeth in the west,",renaissance
"Which by and by black night doth take away,",renaissance
"Death's second self, that seals up all in rest.",renaissance
In me thou see'st the glowing of such fire,renaissance
"That on the ashes of his youth doth lie,",renaissance
"As the death-bed whereon it must expire,",renaissance
Consum'd with that which it was nourish'd by.,renaissance
"This thou perceiv'st, which makes thy love more strong,",renaissance
To love that well which thou must leave ere long.,renaissance
"Not mine own fears, nor the prophetic soul",renaissance
"Of the wide world dreaming on things to come,",renaissance
"Can yet the lease of my true love control,",renaissance
Suppos'd as forfeit to a confin'd doom.,renaissance
The mortal moon hath her eclipse endur'd,renaissance
And the sad augurs mock their own presage;,renaissance
Incertainties now crown themselves assur'd,renaissance
And peace proclaims olives of endless age.,renaissance
Now with the drops of this most balmy time,renaissance
"My love looks fresh, and Death to me subscribes,",renaissance
"Since, spite of him, I'll live in this poor rhyme,",renaissance
While he insults o'er dull and speechless tribes;,renaissance
"And thou in this shalt find thy monument,",renaissance
When tyrants' crests and tombs of brass are spent.,renaissance
"Alas, 'tis true I have gone here and there",renaissance
"And made myself a motley to the view,",renaissance
"Gor'd mine own thoughts, sold cheap what is most dear,",renaissance
Made old offences of affections new.,renaissance
Most true it is that I have look'd on truth,renaissance
"Askance and strangely: but, by all above,",renaissance
"These blenches gave my heart another youth,",renaissance
And worse essays prov'd thee my best of love.,renaissance
"Now all is done, have what shall have no end!",renaissance
"Mine appetite, I never more will grind",renaissance
"On newer proof, to try an older friend,",renaissance
"A god in love, to whom I am confin'd.",renaissance
"Then give me welcome, next my heaven the best,",renaissance
Even to thy pure and most most loving breast.,renaissance
Let me not to the marriage of true minds,renaissance
Admit impediments. Love is not love,renaissance
"Which alters when it alteration finds,",renaissance
Or bends with the remover to remove.,renaissance
O no! it is an ever-fixed mark,renaissance
That looks on tempests and is never shaken;,renaissance
"It is the star to every wand'ring bark,",renaissance
"Whose worth's unknown, although his height be taken.",renaissance
"Love's not Time's fool, though rosy lips and cheeks",renaissance
Within his bending sickle's compass come;,renaissance
"Love alters not with his brief hours and weeks,",renaissance
But bears it out even to the edge of doom.,renaissance
"If this be error and upon me prov'd,",renaissance
"I never writ, nor no man ever lov'd.",renaissance
Th' expense of spirit in a waste of shame,renaissance
"Is lust in action; and till action, lust",renaissance
"Is perjured, murd'rous, bloody, full of blame,",renaissance
"Savage, extreme, rude, cruel, not to trust,",renaissance
"Enjoyed no sooner but despised straight,",renaissance
"Past reason hunted; and, no sooner had",renaissance
Past reason hated as a swallowed bait,renaissance
On purpose laid to make the taker mad;,renaissance
"Mad in pursuit and in possession so,",renaissance
"Had, having, and in quest to have, extreme;",renaissance
"A bliss in proof and proved, a very woe;",renaissance
"Before, a joy proposed; behind, a dream.",renaissance
    All this the world well knows; yet none knows well,renaissance
    To shun the heaven that leads men to this hell.,renaissance
    My mistress' eyes are nothing like the sun;,renaissance
Coral is far more red than her lips' red;,renaissance
"If snow be white, why then her breasts are dun;",renaissance
"If hairs be wires, black wires grow on her head.",renaissance
"I have seen roses damasked, red and white,",renaissance
But no such roses see I in her cheeks;,renaissance
And in some perfumes is there more delight,renaissance
Than in the breath that from my mistress reeks.,renaissance
"I love to hear her speak, yet well I know",renaissance
That music hath a far more pleasing sound;,renaissance
I grant I never saw a goddess go;,renaissance
"My mistress, when she walks, treads on the ground.",renaissance
"   And yet, by heaven, I think my love as rare",renaissance
   As any she belied with false compare.,renaissance
"   Poor soul, the centre of my sinful earth,",renaissance
"[......] these rebel powers that thee array,",renaissance
"Why dost thou pine within and suffer dearth,",renaissance
Painting thy outward walls so costly gay?,renaissance
"Why so large cost, having so short a lease,",renaissance
Dost thou upon thy fading mansion spend?,renaissance
"Shall worms, inheritors of this excess,",renaissance
Eat up thy charge? Is this thy body's end?,renaissance
"Then soul, live thou upon thy servant's loss",renaissance
And let that pine to aggravate thy store;,renaissance

Were stretcht now forth at length without entraile.,renaissance

"Armed to point, sought backe to turne againe;",renaissance
"For light she hated as the deadly bale,",renaissance
"Ay wont in desert darknesse to remaine,",renaissance
"Where plaine none might her see, nor she see any plaine.",renaissance
"Which when the valiant Elfe perceiv'd, he lept",renaissance
"As Lyon fierce upon the flying pray,",renaissance
And with his trenchand blade her boldly kept,renaissance
"From turning backe, and forced her to stay:",renaissance
"Therewith enrag'd she loudly gan to bray,",renaissance
"And turning fierce, her speckled taile advaunst,",renaissance

And all attonce her beastly body raizd,renaissance
With doubled forces high above the ground:,renaissance
"Tho wrapping up her wrethed sterne arownd,",renaissance
"Lept fierce upon his shield, and her huge traine",renaissance

That hand or foot to stirre he strove in vaine:,renaissance
God helpe the man so wrapt in Errours endlesse traine.,renaissance
"His Lady sad to see his sore constraint,",renaissance
"Cride out, Now now Sir knight, shew what ye bee,",renaissance
"Add faith unto your force, and be not faint:",renaissance
"Strangle her, else she sure will strangle thee.",renaissance
"That when he heard, in great perplexitie,",renaissance
"His gall did grate for griefe and high disdaine,",renaissance
"And knitting all his force got one hand free,",renaissance
"Wherewith he grypt her gorge with so great paine,",renaissance
That soone to loose her wicked bands did her constraine.,renaissance
Therewith she spewd out of her filthy maw,renaissance

"Which stunck so vildly, that it forst him slacke",renaissance
"His grasping hold, and from her turne him backe:",renaissance
"Her vomit full of bookes and papers was,",renaissance
"With loathly frogs and toades, which eyes did lacke,",renaissance
And creeping sought way in the weedy gras:,renaissance
Her filthy parbreake all the place defiled has.,renaissance
As when old father Nilus gins to swell,renaissance
"With timely pride above the Aegyptian vale,",renaissance
"His fattie waves do fertile slime outwell,",renaissance
And overflow each plaine and lowly dale:,renaissance

She poured forth out of her hellish sinke,renaissance
"Her fruitfull cursed spawne of serpents small,",renaissance
"Deformed monsters, fowle, and blacke as inke,",renaissance
"Which swarming all about his legs did crall,",renaissance

Weening their wonted entrance to have found,renaissance
At her wide mouth: but being there withstood,renaissance
"They flocked all about her bleeding wound,",renaissance
"And sucked up their dying mothers blood,",renaissance
"Making her death their life, and eke her hurt their good.",renaissance
"That detestable sight him much amazde,",renaissance
"To see th'unkindly Impes of heaven accurst,",renaissance

"And proov'd your strength on a strong enimie,",renaissance
"Your first adventure: many such I pray,",renaissance
"And henceforth ever wish, that like succeed it may.",renaissance
"Then mounted he upon his Steede againe,",renaissance
And with the Lady backward sought to wend;,renaissance
"That path he kept, which beaten was most plame,",renaissance
"Ne ever would to any by-way bend,",renaissance
"But still did follow one unto the end,",renaissance
The which at last out of the wood them brought.,renaissance
So forward on his way (with God to frend),renaissance
"He passed forth, and new adventure sought;",renaissance
"Long way he travelled, before he heard of ought.",renaissance
At length they chaunst to meet upon the way,renaissance
"An aged Sire, in long blacke weedes yclad,",renaissance
"His feete all bare, his beard all hoarie gray,",renaissance
And by his belt his booke he hanging had;,renaissance
"Sober he seemde, and very sagely sad,",renaissance
"And to the ground his eyes were lowly bent,",renaissance
"Simple in shew, and voyde of malice bad,",renaissance
"And all the way he prayed, as he went,",renaissance
"And often knockt his brest, as one that did repent.",renaissance
"He faire the knight saluted, louting low,",renaissance
"Who faire him quited, as that courteous was:",renaissance
"And after asked him, if he did know",renaissance
"Of straunge adventures, which abroad did pas.",renaissance
"Ah my deare Sonne (quoth he) how should, alas,",renaissance
"Silly old man, that lives in hidden cell,",renaissance
"Bidding his beades all day for his trespas,",renaissance
Tydings of warre and worldly trouble tell?,renaissance
With holy father sits not with such things to mell.,renaissance

"Of a straunge man I can you tidings tell,",renaissance
That wasteth all this countrey farre and neare.,renaissance
"Of such (said he) I chiefly do inquere,",renaissance
"And shall you well reward to shew the place,",renaissance
In which that wicked wight his dayes doth weare:,renaissance
"For to all knighthood it is foule disgrace,",renaissance
That such a cursed creature lives so long a space.,renaissance
Far hence (quoth he) in wastfull wildernesse,renaissance
"His dwelling is, by which no living wight",renaissance
"May ever passe, but thorough great distresse.",renaissance
"Now (sayd the Lady) draweth toward night,",renaissance

Is wisely to advise: now day is spent;,renaissance
Therefore with me ye may take up your In,renaissance
For this same night. The knight was well content:,renaissance
So with that godly father to his home they went.,renaissance
"A little lowly Hermitage it was,",renaissance
"Downe in a dale, hard by a forests side,",renaissance
"Far from resort of people, that did pas",renaissance
In travell to and froe: a little wyde,renaissance
"There was an holy Chappell edifyde,",renaissance
Wherein the Hermite dewly wont to say,renaissance
His holy things each morne and eventyde:,renaissance
"Thereby a Christall streame did gently play,",renaissance
Which from a sacred fountaine welled forth alway.,renaissance
"Arrived there, the little house they fill,",renaissance
"Ne looke for entertainement, where none was:",renaissance
"Rest is their feast, and all things at their will;",renaissance
The noblest mind the best contentment has.,renaissance
With faire discourse the evening so they pas:,renaissance
"For that old man of pleasing wordes had store,",renaissance
And well could file his tongue as smooth as glas;,renaissance
"He told of Saintes and Popes, and evermore",renaissance
He strowd an Ave-Mary after and before.,renaissance
"The drouping Night thus creepeth on them fast,",renaissance
"And the sad humour loading their eye liddes,",renaissance
As messenger of Morpheus on them cast,renaissance
"Sweet slombring deaw, the which to sleepe them biddes.",renaissance
Unto their lodgings then his guestes he riddes:,renaissance
"Where when all drownd in deadly sleepe he findes,",renaissance
"He to his study goes, and there amiddes",renaissance
"His Magick bookes and artes of sundry kindes,",renaissance
"He seekes out mighty charmes, to trouble sleepy mindes.",renaissance

"(Let none them read) thereof did verses frame,",renaissance
"With which and other spelles like terrible,",renaissance
"He bad awake blacke Plutoes griesly Dame,",renaissance
"And cursed heaven, and spake reprochfull shame",renaissance

"A bold bad man, that dar'd to call by name",renaissance

And forth he cald out of deepe darknesse dred,renaissance
"Legions of Sprights, the which like little flyes",renaissance
"Fluttring about his ever damned hed,",renaissance
"A-waite whereto their service he applyes,",renaissance
"To aide his friends, or fray his enimies:",renaissance
"Of those he chose out two, the falsest twoo,",renaissance
And fittest for to forge true-seeming lyes;,renaissance

His dwelling is; there Tethys his wet bed,renaissance

"Whose double gates he findeth locked fast,",renaissance
"The one faire fram'd of burnisht Yvory,",renaissance
The other all with silver overcast;,renaissance
And wakefull dogges before them farre do lye,renaissance
"Watching to banish Care their enimy,",renaissance
Who oft is wont to trouble gentle Sleepe.,renaissance

"And unto Morpheus comes, whom drowned deepe",renaissance
In drowsie fit he findes: of nothing he takes keepe.,renaissance

A trickling streame from high rocke tumbling downe,renaissance
"And ever-drizling raine upon the loft,",renaissance
"Mixt with a murmuring winde, much like the sowne",renaissance
"Of swarming Bees, did cast him in a swowne:",renaissance

Wrapt in eternall silence farre from enemyes.,renaissance
"The messenger approching to him spake,",renaissance
But his wast wordes returnd to him in vaine:,renaissance

Bathed in wanton blis and wicked joy:,renaissance

"In view and opposite two cities stood,",renaissance
"Sea-borderers, disjoin'd by Neptune's might;",renaissance
"The one Abydos, the other Sestos hight.",renaissance
"At Sestos Hero dwelt; Hero the fair,",renaissance
"Whom young Apollo courted for her hair,",renaissance
"And offer'd as a dower his burning throne,",renaissance
Where she could sit for men to gaze upon.,renaissance
"The outside of her garments were of lawn,",renaissance
"The lining purple silk, with gilt stars drawn;",renaissance
"Her wide sleeves green, and border'd with a grove,",renaissance
Where Venus in her naked glory strove,renaissance
To please the careless and disdainful eyes,renaissance
"Of proud Adonis, that before her lies;",renaissance
"Her kirtle blue, whereon was many a stain,",renaissance
Made with the blood of wretched lovers slain.,renaissance
"Upon her head she ware a myrtle wreath,",renaissance
From whence her veil reach'd to the ground beneath;,renaissance
"Her veil was artificial flowers and leaves,",renaissance
Whose workmanship both man and beast deceives;,renaissance
"Many would praise the sweet smell as she past,",renaissance
When 'twas the odour which her breath forth cast;,renaissance
"And there for honey bees have sought in vain,",renaissance
"And beat from thence, have lighted there again.",renaissance
"About her neck hung chains of pebble-stone,",renaissance
"Which lighten'd by her neck, like diamonds shone.",renaissance
She ware no gloves; for neither sun nor wind,renaissance
"Would burn or parch her hands, but, to her mind,",renaissance
"Or warm or cool them, for they took delight",renaissance
"To play upon those hands, they were so white.",renaissance
"Buskins of shells, all silver'd, used she,",renaissance
And branch'd with blushing coral to the knee;,renaissance
"Where sparrows perch'd, of hollow pearl and gold,",renaissance
Such as the world would wonder to behold:,renaissance
"Those with sweet water oft her handmaid fills,",renaissance
"Which as she went, would chirrup through the bills.",renaissance
"Some say, for her the fairest Cupid pin'd,",renaissance
"And looking in her face, was strooken blind.",renaissance
"But this is true; so like was one the other,",renaissance
As he imagin'd Hero was his mother;,renaissance
"And oftentimes into her bosom flew,",renaissance
"About her naked neck his bare arms threw,",renaissance
"And laid his childish head upon her breast,",renaissance
And with still panting rock'd there took his rest.,renaissance
"So lovely-fair was Hero, Venus' nun,",renaissance
"As Nature wept, thinking she was undone,",renaissance
"Because she took more from her than she left,",renaissance
And of such wondrous beauty her bereft:,renaissance
"Therefore, in sign her treasure suffer'd wrack,",renaissance
Since Hero's time hath half the world been black.,renaissance
"         Amorous Leander, beautiful and young",renaissance
"(Whose tragedy divine Musus sung),",renaissance
Dwelt at Abydos; since him dwelt there none,renaissance
For whom succeeding times make greater moan.,renaissance
"His dangling tresses, that were never shorn,",renaissance
"Had they been cut, and unto Colchos borne,",renaissance
Would have allur'd the vent'rous youth of Greece,renaissance
To hazard more than for the golden fleece.,renaissance
Fair Cynthia wish'd his arms might be her sphere;,renaissance
"Grief makes her pale, because she moves not there.",renaissance
His body was as straight as Circe's wand;,renaissance
Jove might have sipt out nectar from his hand.,renaissance
"Even as delicious meat is to the taste,",renaissance
"So was his neck in touching, and surpast",renaissance
"The white of Pelops' shoulder: I could tell ye,",renaissance
"How smooth his breast was, and how white his belly;",renaissance
And whose immortal fingers did imprint,renaissance
That heavenly path with many a curious dint,renaissance
That runs along his back; but my rude pen,renaissance
"Can hardly blazon forth the loves of men,",renaissance
Much less of powerful gods: let it suffice,renaissance
That my slack Muse sings of Leander's eyes;,renaissance
"Those orient cheeks and lips, exceeding his",renaissance
That leapt into the water for a kiss,renaissance
"Of his own shadow, and, despising many,",renaissance
Died ere he could enjoy the love of any.,renaissance
"Had wild Hippolytus Leander seen,",renaissance
Enamour'd of his beauty had he been.,renaissance
"His presence made the rudest peasant melt,",renaissance
That in the vast uplandish country dwelt;,renaissance
"The barbarous Thracian soldier, mov'd with nought,",renaissance
"Was mov'd with him, and for his favour sought.",renaissance
"Some swore he was a maid in man's attire,",renaissance
"For in his looks were all that men desire,",renaissance
"A pleasant smiling cheek, a speaking eye,",renaissance
A brow for love to banquet royally;,renaissance
"And such as knew he was a man, would say,",renaissance
"Leander, thou art made for amorous play;",renaissance
"Why art thou not in love, and lov'd of all?",renaissance
"Though thou be fair, yet be not thine own thrall.",renaissance
"         The men of wealthy Sestos every year,",renaissance
"For his sake whom their goddess held so dear,",renaissance
"Rose-cheek'd Adonis, kept a solemn feast.",renaissance
Thither resorted many a wandering guest,renaissance
To meet their loves; such as had none at all,renaissance
Came lovers home from this great festival;,renaissance
"For every street, like to a firmament,",renaissance
"Glister'd with breathing stars, who, where they went,",renaissance
"Frighted the melancholy earth, which deem'd",renaissance
"Eternal heaven to burn, for so it seem'd",renaissance
"As if another Pha{""e}ton had got",renaissance
The guidance of the sun's rich chariot.,renaissance
"But far above the loveliest, Hero shin'd,",renaissance
And stole away th' enchanted gazer's mind;,renaissance
"For like sea-nymphs' inveigling harmony,",renaissance
So was her beauty to the standers-by;,renaissance
"Nor that night-wandering, pale, and watery star",renaissance
(When yawning dragons draw her thirling car,renaissance
"From Latmus' mount up to the gloomy sky,",renaissance
"Where, crown'd with blazing light and majesty,",renaissance
She proudly sits) more over-rules the flood,renaissance
Than she the hearts of those that near her stood.,renaissance
"Even as when gaudy nymphs pursue the chase,",renaissance
"Wretched Ixion's shaggy-footed race,",renaissance
"Incens'd with savage heat, gallop amain",renaissance
"From steep pine-bearing mountains to the plain,",renaissance
"So ran the people forth to gaze upon her,",renaissance
And all that view'd her were enamour'd on her.,renaissance
"And as in fury of a dreadful fight,",renaissance
"Their fellows being slain or put to flight,",renaissance
"Poor soldiers stand with fear of death dead-strooken,",renaissance
"So at her presence all surpris'd and tooken,",renaissance
Await the sentence of her scornful eyes;,renaissance
He whom she favours lives; the other dies.,renaissance
"There might you see one sigh, another rage,",renaissance
"And some, their violent passions to assuage,",renaissance
"Compile sharp satires; but, alas, too late,",renaissance
For faithful love will never turn to hate.,renaissance
"And many, seeing great princes were denied,",renaissance
"Pin'd as they went, and thinking on her, died.",renaissance
On this feast-dayO cursed day and hour!,renaissance
"Went Hero thorough Sestos, from her tower",renaissance
"To Venus' temple, where unhappily,",renaissance
"As after chanc'd, they did each other spy.",renaissance
So fair a church as this had Venus none:,renaissance
"The walls were of discolour'd jasper-stone,",renaissance
Wherein was Proteus carved; and over-head,renaissance
"A lively vine of green sea-agate spread,",renaissance
"Where by one hand light-headed Bacchus hung,",renaissance
And with the other wine from grapes out-wrung.,renaissance
Of crystal shining fair the pavement was;,renaissance
The town of Sestos call'd it Venus' glass:,renaissance
"There might you see the gods in sundry shapes,",renaissance
"Committing heady riots, incest, rapes:",renaissance
"For know, that underneath this radiant flower",renaissance
"Was Danae's statue in a brazen tower,",renaissance
"Jove slyly stealing from his sister's bed,",renaissance
"To dally with Idalian Ganimed,",renaissance
"And for his love Europa bellowing loud,",renaissance
And tumbling with the rainbow in a cloud;,renaissance
"Blood-quaffing Mars heaving the iron net,",renaissance
Which limping Vulcan and his Cyclops set;,renaissance
"Love kindling fire, to burn such towns as Troy,",renaissance
Sylvanus weeping for the lovely boy,renaissance
"That now is turn'd into a cypress tree,",renaissance
Under whose shade the wood-gods love to be.,renaissance
And in the midst a silver altar stood:,renaissance
"There Hero, sacrificing turtles' blood,",renaissance
"Vail'd to the ground, veiling her eyelids close;",renaissance
And modestly they opened as she rose.,renaissance
Thence flew Love's arrow with the golden head;,renaissance
And thus Leander was enamoured.,renaissance
"Stone-still he stood, and evermore he gazed,",renaissance
Till with the fire that from his count'nance blazed,renaissance
Relenting Hero's gentle heart was strook:,renaissance
Such force and virtue hath an amorous look.,renaissance
"         It lies not in our power to love or hate,",renaissance
For will in us is over-rul'd by fate.,renaissance
"When two are stript, long ere the course begin,",renaissance
"We wish that one should lose, the other win;",renaissance
And one especially do we affect,renaissance
"Of two gold ingots, like in each respect:",renaissance
"The reason no man knows, let it suffice,",renaissance
What we behold is censur'd by our eyes.,renaissance
"Where both deliberate, the love is slight:",renaissance
"Who ever lov'd, that lov'd not at first sight?",renaissance
"By that he ended had his ghostly sermon,",renaissance
"The fox was well induc'd to be a parson,",renaissance
"And of the priest eftsoons gan to inquire,",renaissance
How to a benefice he might aspire.,renaissance
"Marry, there (said the priest) ""is art indeed:",renaissance
Much good deep learning one thereout may read;,renaissance
"For that the ground-work is, and end of all,",renaissance
How to obtain a beneficial.,renaissance
"First, therefore, when ye have in handsome wise",renaissance
"Yourself attired, as you can devise,",renaissance
"Then to some nobleman yourself apply,",renaissance
"Or other great one in the worldes eye,",renaissance
That hath a zealous disposition,renaissance
"To God, and so to his religion.",renaissance
"There must thou fashion eke a godly zeal,",renaissance
Such as no carpers may contrare reveal;,renaissance
For each thing feigned ought more wary be.,renaissance
"There thou must walk in sober gravity,",renaissance
And seem as saint-like as Saint Radegund:,renaissance
"Fast much, pray oft, look lowly on the ground,",renaissance
And unto every one do courtesy meek:,renaissance
"These looks (nought saying) do a benefice seek,",renaissance
But be thou sure one not to lack or long.,renaissance
"And if thee list unto the court to throng,",renaissance
"And there to hunt after the hoped prey,",renaissance
Then must thou thee dispose another way:,renaissance
"For there thou needs must learn to laugh, to lie,",renaissance
"To face, to forge, to scoff, to company,",renaissance
"To crouch, to please, to be a beetle-stock",renaissance
"Of thy great master's will, to scorn, or mock.",renaissance
"So may'st thou chance mock out a benefice,",renaissance
"Unless thou canst one conjure by device,",renaissance
Or cast a figure for a bishopric;,renaissance
"And if one could, it were but a school trick.",renaissance
These be the ways by which without reward,renaissance
"Livings in court be gotten, though full hard;",renaissance
For nothing there is done without a fee:,renaissance
The courtier needs must recompensed be,renaissance
"With a benevolence, or have in gage",renaissance
The primitias of your parsonage:,renaissance
"Scarce can a bishopric forpass them by,",renaissance
But that it must be gelt in privity.,renaissance
"Do not thou therefore seek a living there,",renaissance
"But of more private persons seek elsewhere,",renaissance
"Whereas thou may'st compound a better penny,",renaissance
Ne let thy learning question'd be of any.,renaissance
"For some good gentleman, that hath the right",renaissance
"Unto his church for to present a wight,",renaissance
Will cope with thee in reasonable wise;,renaissance
That if the living yearly do arise,renaissance
"To forty pound, that then his youngest son",renaissance
"Shall twenty have, and twenty thou hast won:",renaissance
"Thou hast it won, for it is of frank gift,",renaissance
"And he will care for all the rest to shift,",renaissance
"Both that the bishop may admit of thee,",renaissance
And that therein thou may'st maintained be.,renaissance
This is the way for one that is unlearn'd,renaissance
"Living to get, and not to be discern'd.",renaissance
"But they that are great clerks, have nearer ways,",renaissance
For learning sake to living them to raise;,renaissance
Yet many eke of them (God wot) are driven,renaissance
T' accept a benefice in pieces riven.,renaissance
"How say'st thou (friend), have I not well discourst",renaissance
"Upon this common-place (though plain, not worst)?",renaissance
Better a short tale than a bad long shriving.,renaissance
"Needs any more to learn to get a living?""",renaissance
"Now sure, and by my halidom, (quoth he)",renaissance
Ye a great master are in your degree:,renaissance
"Great thanks I yield you for your discipline,",renaissance
And do not doubt but duly to incline,renaissance
"My wits thereto, as ye shall shortly hear.",renaissance
"The priest him wish'd good speed, and well to fare:",renaissance
"So parted they, as either's way them led.",renaissance
"But th' ape and fox ere long so well them sped,",renaissance
"Through the priest's wholesome counsel lately taught,",renaissance
"And through their own fair handling wisely wrought,",renaissance
That they a benefice 'twixt them obtained;,renaissance
"And crafty Reynold was a priest ordained,",renaissance
And th' ape his parish clerk procur'd to be.,renaissance
Then made they revel rout and goodly glee;,renaissance
"But, ere long time had passed, they so ill",renaissance
"Did order their affairs, that th' evil will",renaissance
Of all their parish'ners they had constrain'd;,renaissance
"Who to the Ordinary of them complain'd,",renaissance
"How foully they their offices abus'd,",renaissance
"And them of crimes and heresies accus'd,",renaissance
That pursuivants he often for them sent;,renaissance
But they neglected his commandement.,renaissance
"So long persisted obstinate and bold,",renaissance
Till at the length he published to hold,renaissance
"A visitation, and them cited thether:",renaissance
Then was high time their wits about to geather.,renaissance
"What did they then, but made a composition",renaissance
"With their next neighbour priest, for light condition,",renaissance
To whom their living they resigned quite,renaissance
"For a few pence, and ran away by night.",renaissance
"CALM was the day, and through the trembling air",renaissance
"Sweet breathing Zephyrus did softly play,",renaissance
"A gentle spirit, that lightly did delay",renaissance
"Hot Titan's beams, which then did glister fair;",renaissance
"When I whose sullen care,",renaissance
Through discontent of my long fruitless stay,renaissance
"In prince's court, and expectation vain",renaissance
"Of idle hopes, which still do fly away",renaissance
"Like empty shadows, did afflict my brain,",renaissance
Walked forth to ease my pain,renaissance
"Along the shore of silver streaming Thames,",renaissance
"Whose rutty bank, the which his river hems,",renaissance
"Was painted all with variable flowers,",renaissance
"And all the meads adorned with dainty gems,",renaissance
"Fit to deck maidens' bowers,",renaissance
"And crown their paramours,",renaissance
"Against the bridal day, which is not long:",renaissance
"      Sweet Thames, run softly, till I end my song.",renaissance
"There, in a meadow, by the river's side,",renaissance
"A flock of nymphs I chanced to espy,",renaissance
"All lovely daughters of the flood thereby,",renaissance
"With goodly greenish locks, all loose untied,",renaissance
As each had been a bride;,renaissance
"And each one had a little wicker basket,",renaissance
"Made of fine twigs, entrailed curiously,",renaissance
"In which they gathered flowers to fill their flasket,",renaissance
And with fine fingers cropt full featously,renaissance
The tender stalks on high.,renaissance
"Of every sort, which in that meadow grew,",renaissance
"They gathered some; the violet pallid blue,",renaissance
"The little daisy, that at evening closes,",renaissance
"The virgin lily, and the primrose true,",renaissance
"With store of vermeil roses,",renaissance
To deck their bridegrooms' posies,renaissance
"Against the bridal day, which was not long:",renaissance
"      Sweet Thames, run softly, till I end my song.",renaissance
"With that, I saw two swans of goodly hue",renaissance
Come softly swimming down along the Lee;,renaissance
Two fairer birds I yet did never see.,renaissance
"The snow which doth the top of Pindus strew,",renaissance
"Did never whiter shew,",renaissance
"Nor Jove himself, when he a swan would be",renaissance
"For love of Leda, whiter did appear:",renaissance
"Yet Leda was they say as white as he,",renaissance
"Yet not so white as these, nor nothing near.",renaissance
"So purely white they were,",renaissance
"That even the gentle stream, the which them bare,",renaissance
"Seemed foul to them, and bade his billows spare",renaissance
"To wet their silken feathers, lest they might",renaissance
"Soil their fair plumes with water not so fair,",renaissance
"And mar their beauties bright,",renaissance
"That shone as heaven's light,",renaissance
"Against their bridal day, which was not long:",renaissance
"      Sweet Thames, run softly, till I end my song.",renaissance
"Eftsoons the nymphs, which now had flowers their fill,",renaissance
"Ran all in haste, to see that silver brood,",renaissance
As they came floating on the crystal flood.,renaissance
"Whom when they saw, they stood amazed still,",renaissance
Their wondering eyes to fill.,renaissance
"Them seemed they never saw a sight so fair,",renaissance
"Of fowls so lovely, that they sure did deem",renaissance
"Them heavenly born, or to be that same pair",renaissance
Which through the sky draw Venus' silver team;,renaissance
For sure they did not seem,renaissance
"To be begot of any earthly seed,",renaissance
"But rather angels, or of angels' breed:",renaissance
"Yet were they bred of Somers-heat they say,",renaissance
"In sweetest season, when each flower and weed",renaissance
"The earth did fresh array,",renaissance
"So fresh they seemed as day,",renaissance
"Even as their bridal day, which was not long:",renaissance
"      Sweet Thames, run softly, till I end my song.",renaissance
Then forth they all out of their baskets drew,renaissance
"Great store of flowers, the honour of the field,",renaissance
"That to the sense did fragrant odours yield,",renaissance
"All which upon those goodly birds they threw,",renaissance
"And all the waves did strew,",renaissance
"That like old Peneus' waters they did seem,",renaissance
"When down along by pleasant Tempe's shore,",renaissance
"Scattered with flowers, through Thessaly they stream,",renaissance
"That they appear through lilies' plenteous store,",renaissance
Like a bride's chamber floor.,renaissance
"Two of those nymphs meanwhile, two garlands bound,",renaissance
"Of freshest flowers which in that mead they found,",renaissance
"The which presenting all in trim array,",renaissance
"Their snowy foreheads therewithal they crowned,",renaissance
"Whilst one did sing this lay,",renaissance
"Prepared against that day,",renaissance
"Against their bridal day, which was not long:",renaissance
"      Sweet Thames, run softly, till I end my song.",renaissance
"'Ye gentle birds, the world's fair ornament,",renaissance
"And heaven's glory, whom this happy hour",renaissance
"Doth lead unto your lovers' blissful bower,",renaissance
Joy may you have and gentle heart's content,renaissance
Of your love's complement:,renaissance
"And let fair Venus, that is queen of love,",renaissance
"With her heart-quelling son upon you smile,",renaissance
"Whose smile, they say, hath virtue to remove",renaissance
"All love's dislike, and friendship's faulty guile",renaissance
For ever to assoil.,renaissance
"Let endless peace your steadfast hearts accord,",renaissance
"And blessed plenty wait upon your board,",renaissance
"And let your bed with pleasures chaste abound,",renaissance
"That fruitful issue may to you afford,",renaissance
"Which may your foes confound,",renaissance
And make your joys redound,renaissance
"Upon your bridal day, which is not long:",renaissance
"      Sweet Thames, run softly, till I end my song.'",renaissance
So ended she; and all the rest around,renaissance
"To her redoubled that her undersong,",renaissance
Which said their bridal day should not be long.,renaissance
And gentle echo from the neighbour ground,renaissance
Their accents did resound.,renaissance
"So forth those joyous birds did pass along,",renaissance
"Adown the Lee, that to them murmured low,",renaissance
"As he would speak, but that he lacked a tongue,",renaissance
"Yet did by signs his glad affection show,",renaissance
Making his stream run slow.,renaissance
And all the fowl which in his flood did dwell,renaissance
"Gan flock about these twain, that did excel",renaissance
The rest so far as Cynthia doth shend,renaissance
"The lesser stars. So they, enranged well,",renaissance
"Did on those two attend,",renaissance
"And their best service lend,",renaissance
"Against their wedding day, which was not long:",renaissance
"      Sweet Thames, run softly, till I end my song.",renaissance
"At length they all to merry London came,",renaissance
"To merry London, my most kindly nurse,",renaissance
That to me gave this life's first native source;,renaissance
"Though from another place I take my name,",renaissance
An house of ancient fame.,renaissance
"There when they came, whereas those bricky towers,",renaissance
"The which on Thames' broad aged back do ride,",renaissance
Where now the studious lawyers have their bowers,renaissance
"There whilom wont the Templar Knights to bide,",renaissance
Till they decayed through pride:,renaissance
"Next whereunto there stands a stately place,",renaissance
Where oft I gained gifts and goodly grace,renaissance
"Of that great lord, which therein wont to dwell,",renaissance
Whose want too well now feels my friendless case.,renaissance
"But ah, here fits not well",renaissance
Old woes but joys to tell,renaissance
"Against the bridal day, which is not long:",renaissance
"      Sweet Thames, run softly, till I end my song.",renaissance
"Yet therein now doth lodge a noble peer,",renaissance
"Great England's glory, and the world's wide wonder,",renaissance
"Whose dreadful name late through all Spain did thunder,",renaissance
And Hercules' two pillars standing near,renaissance
Did make to quake and fear:,renaissance
"Fair branch of honour, flower of chivalry,",renaissance
"That fillest England with thy triumph's fame,",renaissance
"Joy have thou of thy noble victory,",renaissance
And endless happiness of thine own name,renaissance
That promiseth the same:,renaissance
"That through thy prowess and victorious arms,",renaissance
Thy country may be freed from foreign harms;,renaissance
And great Elisa's glorious name may ring,renaissance
"Through all the world, filled with thy wide alarms,",renaissance
Which some brave Muse may sing,renaissance
"To ages following,",renaissance
"Upon the bridal day, which is not long:",renaissance
"      Sweet Thames, run softly, till I end my song.",renaissance
"From those high towers this noble lord issuing,",renaissance
Like radiant Hesper when his golden hair,renaissance
"In th'Ocean billows he hath bathed fair,",renaissance
"Descended to the river's open viewing,",renaissance
With a great train ensuing.,renaissance
Above the rest were goodly to be seen,renaissance
Two gentle knights of lovely face and feature,renaissance
"Beseeming well the bower of any queen,",renaissance
"With gifts of wit and ornaments of nature,",renaissance
Fit for so goodly stature;,renaissance
"That like the twins of Jove they seemed in sight,",renaissance
Which deck the baldric of the heavens bright.,renaissance
"They two forth pacing to the river's side,",renaissance
"Received those two fair birds, their love's delight;",renaissance
"Which, at th' appointed tide,",renaissance
Each one did make his bride,renaissance
"Against their bridal day, which is not long:",renaissance
"      Sweet Thames, run softly, till I end my song.",renaissance
"Tell me good Hobbinoll, what garres thee greete?",renaissance
What? hath some Wolfe thy tender Lambes ytorne?,renaissance
"Or is thy Bagpype broke, that soundes so sweete?",renaissance
Or art thou of thy loved lasse forlorne?,renaissance
"Or bene thine eyes attempred to the yeare,",renaissance
Quenching the gasping furrowes thirst with rayne?,renaissance

"Hys pleasaunt Pipe, whych made us meriment,",renaissance
"He wylfully hath broke, and doth forbeare",renaissance
"His wonted songs, wherein he all outwent.",renaissance
"What is he for a Ladde, you so lament?",renaissance
"Ys love such pinching payne to them, that prove?",renaissance
"And hath he skill to make so excellent,",renaissance
Yet hath so little skill to brydle love?,renaissance
"Colin thou kenst, the Southerne shepheardes boye:",renaissance
Him Love hath wounded with a deadly darte.,renaissance
"Whilome on him was all my care and joye,",renaissance
Forcing with gyfts to winne his wanton heart.,renaissance
"But now from me hys madding mynd is starte,",renaissance
And woes the Widdowes daughter of the glenne:,renaissance
"So nowe fayre Rosalind hath bredde hys smart,",renaissance
So now his frend is chaunged for a frenne.,renaissance
"But if hys ditties bene so trimly dight,",renaissance
"I pray thee Hobbinoll, recorde some one:",renaissance
"The whiles our flockes doe graze about in sight,",renaissance
And we close shrowded in thys shade alone.,renaissance
Contented I: then will I singe his laye,renaissance
"Of fayre Elisa, Queene of shepheardes all:",renaissance
"Which once he made, as by a spring he laye,",renaissance
And tuned it unto the Waters fall.,renaissance
"Ye dayntye Nymphs, that in this blessed Brooke",renaissance
"         doe bathe your brest,",renaissance
"Forsake your watry bowres, and hether looke,",renaissance
         at my request:,renaissance
"And eke you Virgins, that on Parnasse dwell,",renaissance
"Whence floweth Helicon the learned well,",renaissance
         Helpe me to blaze,renaissance
"         Her worthy praise,",renaissance
Which in her sexe doth all excell.,renaissance
"Of fayre Eliza be your silver song,",renaissance
         that blessed wight:,renaissance
"The flowre of Virgins, may shee florish long,",renaissance
         In princely plight.,renaissance
"For shee is Syrinx daughter without spotte,",renaissance
Which Pan the shepheards God of her begot:,renaissance

Our souls (which to advance their state,renaissance

"         We said, and tell us what we love;",renaissance

         We see we saw not what did move;,renaissance
But as all several souls contain,renaissance
"         Mixture of things, they know not what,",renaissance
Love these mix'd souls doth mix again,renaissance

"That abler soul, which thence doth flow,",renaissance
         Defects of loneliness controls.,renaissance

As our blood labors to beget,renaissance
"         Spirits, as like souls as it can,",renaissance
Because such fingers need to knit,renaissance

Sometime a barley corn; sometime a bean;,renaissance
For which she laboured hard both day and night,renaissance
In harvest time whilst she might go and glean;,renaissance
"And where store was stroyed with the flood,",renaissance
Then well away! for she undone was clean.,renaissance

In a round head with sharp ears. In France,renaissance
"Was never mouse so fear'd, for the unwise",renaissance

Yet had nature taught her after her guise,renaissance

At the threshold her silly foot did trip;,renaissance

Than those thy fellow-worms do think upon,renaissance
That carcass's last resurrection?,renaissance

Some figure of the golden times was hid.,renaissance

What fragmentary rubbish this world is,renaissance
"Thou knowest, and that it is not worth a thought;",renaissance
He honours it too much that thinks it nought.,renaissance
"Think then, my soul, that death is but a groom,",renaissance
"Which brings a taper to the outward room,",renaissance
"Whence thou spiest first a little glimmering light,",renaissance
And after brings it nearer to thy sight;,renaissance
For such approaches doth heaven make in death.,renaissance
"Think thyself labouring now with broken breath,",renaissance
And think those broken and soft notes to be,renaissance
"Division, and thy happiest harmony.",renaissance

Melodious birds sing Madrigals.,renaissance

"Hot Titan's beams, which then did glister fair;",renaissance
"When I whose sullen care,",renaissance
Through discontent of my long fruitless stay,renaissance
"In prince's court, and expectation vain",renaissance
"Of idle hopes, which still do fly away",renaissance
"Like empty shadows, did afflict my brain,",renaissance
Walked forth to ease my pain,renaissance
"Along the shore of silver streaming Thames,",renaissance
"Whose rutty bank, the which his river hems,",renaissance
"Was painted all with variable flowers,",renaissance
"And all the meads adorned with dainty gems,",renaissance
"Fit to deck maidens' bowers,",renaissance
"And crown their paramours,",renaissance
"Against the bridal day, which is not long:",renaissance
"      Sweet Thames, run softly, till I end my song.",renaissance
"There, in a meadow, by the river's side,",renaissance
"A flock of nymphs I chanced to espy,",renaissance
"All lovely daughters of the flood thereby,",renaissance
"With goodly greenish locks, all loose untied,",renaissance
As each had been a bride;,renaissance
"And each one had a little wicker basket,",renaissance
"Made of fine twigs, entrailed curiously,",renaissance
"In which they gathered flowers to fill their flasket,",renaissance
And with fine fingers cropt full featously,renaissance
The tender stalks on high.,renaissance
"Of every sort, which in that meadow grew,",renaissance
"They gathered some; the violet pallid blue,",renaissance
"The little daisy, that at evening closes,",renaissance
"The virgin lily, and the primrose true,",renaissance
"With store of vermeil roses,",renaissance
To deck their bridegrooms' posies,renaissance
"Against the bridal day, which was not long:",renaissance
"      Sweet Thames, run softly, till I end my song.",renaissance
"With that, I saw two swans of goodly hue",renaissance
Come softly swimming down along the Lee;,renaissance
Two fairer birds I yet did never see.,renaissance
"The snow which doth the top of Pindus strew,",renaissance
"Did never whiter shew,",renaissance
"Nor Jove himself, when he a swan would be",renaissance
"For love of Leda, whiter did appear:",renaissance
"Yet Leda was they say as white as he,",renaissance
"Yet not so white as these, nor nothing near.",renaissance
"So purely white they were,",renaissance
"That even the gentle stream, the which them bare,",renaissance
"Seemed foul to them, and bade his billows spare",renaissance
"To wet their silken feathers, lest they might",renaissance
"Soil their fair plumes with water not so fair,",renaissance
"And mar their beauties bright,",renaissance
"That shone as heaven's light,",renaissance
"Against their bridal day, which was not long:",renaissance
"      Sweet Thames, run softly, till I end my song.",renaissance
"Eftsoons the nymphs, which now had flowers their fill,",renaissance
"Ran all in haste, to see that silver brood,",renaissance
As they came floating on the crystal flood.,renaissance
"Whom when they saw, they stood amazed still,",renaissance
Their wondering eyes to fill.,renaissance
"Them seemed they never saw a sight so fair,",renaissance
"Of fowls so lovely, that they sure did deem",renaissance
"Them heavenly born, or to be that same pair",renaissance
Which through the sky draw Venus' silver team;,renaissance
For sure they did not seem,renaissance
"To be begot of any earthly seed,",renaissance
"But rather angels, or of angels' breed:",renaissance
"Yet were they bred of Somers-heat they say,",renaissance
"In sweetest season, when each flower and weed",renaissance
"The earth did fresh array,",renaissance
"So fresh they seemed as day,",renaissance
"Even as their bridal day, which was not long:",renaissance
"      Sweet Thames, run softly, till I end my song.",renaissance
Then forth they all out of their baskets drew,renaissance
"Great store of flowers, the honour of the field,",renaissance
"That to the sense did fragrant odours yield,",renaissance
"All which upon those goodly birds they threw,",renaissance
"And all the waves did strew,",renaissance
"That like old Peneus' waters they did seem,",renaissance
"When down along by pleasant Tempe's shore,",renaissance
"Scattered with flowers, through Thessaly they stream,",renaissance
"That they appear through lilies' plenteous store,",renaissance
Like a bride's chamber floor.,renaissance
"Two of those nymphs meanwhile, two garlands bound,",renaissance
"Of freshest flowers which in that mead they found,",renaissance
"The which presenting all in trim array,",renaissance
"Their snowy foreheads therewithal they crowned,",renaissance
"Whilst one did sing this lay,",renaissance
"Prepared against that day,",renaissance
"Against their bridal day, which was not long:",renaissance
"      Sweet Thames, run softly, till I end my song.",renaissance
"'Ye gentle birds, the world's fair ornament,",renaissance
"And heaven's glory, whom this happy hour",renaissance
"Doth lead unto your lovers' blissful bower,",renaissance
Joy may you have and gentle heart's content,renaissance
Of your love's complement:,renaissance
"And let fair Venus, that is queen of love,",renaissance
"With her heart-quelling son upon you smile,",renaissance
"Whose smile, they say, hath virtue to remove",renaissance
"All love's dislike, and friendship's faulty guile",renaissance
For ever to assoil.,renaissance
"Let endless peace your steadfast hearts accord,",renaissance
"And blessed plenty wait upon your board,",renaissance

And make your joys redound,renaissance
"Upon your bridal day, which is not long:",renaissance
"      Sweet Thames, run softly, till I end my song.'",renaissance
So ended she; and all the rest around,renaissance
"To her redoubled that her undersong,",renaissance
Which said their bridal day should not be long.,renaissance
And gentle echo from the neighbour ground,renaissance
Their accents did resound.,renaissance
"So forth those joyous birds did pass along,",renaissance
"Adown the Lee, that to them murmured low,",renaissance
"As he would speak, but that he lacked a tongue,",renaissance
"Yet did by signs his glad affection show,",renaissance
Making his stream run slow.,renaissance
And all the fowl which in his flood did dwell,renaissance
"Gan flock about these twain, that did excel",renaissance
The rest so far as Cynthia doth shend,renaissance
"The lesser stars. So they, enranged well,",renaissance
"Did on those two attend,",renaissance
"And their best service lend,",renaissance
"Against their wedding day, which was not long:",renaissance
"      Sweet Thames, run softly, till I end my song.",renaissance
"At length they all to merry London came,",renaissance
"To merry London, my most kindly nurse,",renaissance
That to me gave this life's first native source;,renaissance
"Though from another place I take my name,",renaissance
An house of ancient fame.,renaissance
"There when they came, whereas those bricky towers,",renaissance
"The which on Thames' broad aged back do ride,",renaissance
Where now the studious lawyers have their bowers,renaissance
"There whilom wont the Templar Knights to bide,",renaissance
Till they decayed through pride:,renaissance
"Next whereunto there stands a stately place,",renaissance
Where oft I gained gifts and goodly grace,renaissance
