The day before Curl Trenary,modern_love
Swore out a warrant through Justice Arnett,modern_love
For stealing hogs.,modern_love
But that's not the reason he turned a soldier.,modern_love
He caught me running with Lucius Atherton.,modern_love
We quarreled and I told him never again,modern_love
To cross my path.,modern_love
Then he stole the hogs and went to the war,modern_love
Back of every soldier is a woman.He protested all his life long,modern_love
The newspapers lied about him villainously;,modern_love
"That he was not at fault for Minerva's fall,",modern_love
But only tried to help her.,modern_love
Poor soul so sunk in sin he could not see,modern_love
"That even trying to help her, as he called it,",modern_love
He had broken the law human and divine.,modern_love
"Passers by, an ancient admonition to you:",modern_love
"If your ways would be ways of pleasantness,",modern_love
"And all your pathways peace,",modern_love
Love God and keep his commandments.,modern_love
"And lights were paling out of the West,",modern_love
"You would come hither, and bend your head,",modern_love
And I would lay my head on your breast;,modern_love
"And you would murmur tender words,",modern_love
"Forgiving me, because you were dead:",modern_love
"Nor would you rise and hasten away,",modern_love
"Though you have the will of wild birds,",modern_love
But know your hair was bound and wound,modern_love
About the stars and moon and sun:,modern_love
"O would, beloved, that you lay",modern_love
"Under the dock-leaves in the ground,",modern_love
"While lights were paling one by one.Never give all the heart, for love",modern_love
Will hardly seem worth thinking of,modern_love
To passionate women if it seem,modern_love
"Certain, and they never dream",modern_love
That it fades out from kiss to kiss;,modern_love
For everything thats lovely is,modern_love
"But a brief, dreamy, kind delight.",modern_love
"O never give the heart outright,",modern_love
"For they, for all smooth lips can say,",modern_love
Have given their hearts up to the play.,modern_love
And who could play it well enough,modern_love
If deaf and dumb and blind with love?,modern_love
"He that made this knows all the cost,",modern_love
For he gave all his heart and lost.Why should I blame her that she filled my days,modern_love
"With misery, or that she would of late",modern_love
"Have taught to ignorant men most violent ways,",modern_love
"Or hurled the little streets upon the great,",modern_love
Had they but courage equal to desire?,modern_love
What could have made her peaceful with a mind,modern_love
"That nobleness made simple as a fire,",modern_love
"With beauty like a tightened bow, a kind",modern_love
"That is not natural in an age like this,",modern_love
Being high and solitary and most stern?,modern_love
"Why, what could she have done, being what she is?",modern_love
Was there another Troy for her to burn?Some may have blamed you that you took away,modern_love
The verses that could move them on the day,modern_love
"When, the ears being deafened, the sight of the eyes blind",modern_love
"With lightning, you went from me, and I could find",modern_love
"Nothing to make a song about but kings,",modern_love
"Helmets, and swords, and half-forgotten things",modern_love
That were like memories of youbut now,modern_love
"We'll out, for the world lives as long ago;",modern_love
"And while we're in our laughing, weeping fit,",modern_love
"Hurl helmets, crowns, and swords into the pit.",modern_love
When the world turns completely upside down,modern_love
You say well emigrate to the Eastern Shore,modern_love
Aboard a river-boat from Baltimore;,modern_love
"Well live among wild peach trees, miles from town,",modern_love
"Youll wear a coonskin cap, and I a gown",modern_love
"Homespun, dyed butternuts dark gold color.",modern_love
"Lost, like your lotus-eating ancestor,",modern_love
Well swim in milk and honey till we drown.,modern_love
"The winter will be short, the summer long,",modern_love
"The autumn amber-hued, sunny and hot,",modern_love
Tasting of cider and of scuppernong;,modern_love
"All seasons sweet, but autumn best of all.",modern_love
The squirrels in their silver fur will fall,modern_love
"Like falling leaves, like fruit, before your shot.",modern_love
The autumn frosts will lie upon the grass,modern_love
Like bloom on grapes of purple-brown and gold.,modern_love
The misted early mornings will be cold;,modern_love
The little puddles will be roofed with glass.,modern_love
"The sun, which burns from copper into brass,",modern_love
"Melts these at noon, and makes the boys unfold",modern_love
Their knitted mufflers; full as they can hold,modern_love
Fat pockets dribble chestnuts as they pass.,modern_love
"Peaches grow wild, and pigs can live in clover;",modern_love
A barrel of salted herrings lasts a year;,modern_love
The spring begins before the winters over.,modern_love
By February you may find the skins,modern_love
Of garter snakes and water moccasins,modern_love
"Dwindled and harsh, dead-white and cloudy-clear.",modern_love
When April pours the colors of a shell,modern_love
"Upon the hills, when every little creek",modern_love
Is shot with silver from the Chesapeake,modern_love
"In shoals new-minted by the ocean swell,",modern_love
"When strawberries go begging, and the sleek",modern_love
"Blue plums lie open to the blackbirds beak,",modern_love
We shall live well  we shall live very well.,modern_love
The months between the cherries and the peaches,modern_love
Are brimming cornucopias which spill,modern_love
"Fruits red and purple, sombre-bloomed and black;",modern_love
"Then, down rich fields and frosty river beaches",modern_love
"Well trample bright persimmons, while you kill",modern_love
"Bronze partridge, speckled quail, and canvasback.",modern_love
Down to the Puritan marrow of my bones,modern_love
Theres something in this richness that I hate.,modern_love
"I love the look, austere, immaculate,",modern_love
Of landscapes drawn in pearly monotones.,modern_love
Theres something in my very blood that owns,modern_love
"Bare hills, cold silver on a sky of slate,",modern_love
"A thread of water, churned to milky spate",modern_love
Streaming through slanted pastures fenced with stones.,modern_love
"I love those skies, thin blue or snowy gray,",modern_love
"Those fields sparse-planted, rendering meagre sheaves;",modern_love
"That spring, briefer than apple-blossoms breath,",modern_love
"Summer, so much too beautiful to stay,",modern_love
"Swift autumn, like a bonfire of leaves,",modern_love
"And sleepy winter, like the sleep of death.",modern_love
Come when the nights are bright with stars,modern_love
Or come when the moon is mellow;,modern_love
Come when the sun his golden bars,modern_love
Drops on the hay-field yellow.,modern_love
"Come in the twilight soft and gray,",modern_love
"Come in the night or come in the day,",modern_love
"Come, O love, wheneer you may,",modern_love
"And you are welcome, welcome.",modern_love
"You are sweet, O Love, dear Love,",modern_love
You are soft as the nesting dove.,modern_love
Come to my heart and bring it to rest,modern_love
As the bird flies home to its welcome nest.,modern_love
Come when my heart is full of grief,modern_love
Or when my heart is merry;,modern_love
Come with the falling of the leaf,modern_love
Or with the reddning cherry.,modern_love
"Come when the years first blossom blows,",modern_love
"Come when the summer gleams and glows,",modern_love
"Come with the winters drifting snows,",modern_love
"And you are welcome, welcome.",modern_love
"Too high, too high to pluck",modern_love
My heart shall swing.,modern_love
"A fruit no bee shall suck,",modern_love
No wasp shall sting.,modern_love
If on some night of cold,modern_love
It falls to ground,modern_love
In apple-leaves of gold,modern_love
Ill wrap it round.,modern_love
And I shall seal it up,modern_love
"With spice and salt,",modern_love
"In a carven silver cup,",modern_love
In a deep vault.,modern_love
Before my eyes are blind,modern_love
"And my lips mute,",modern_love
I must eat core and rind,modern_love
Of that same fruit.,modern_love
Before my heart is dust,modern_love
"At the end of all,",modern_love
"Eat it I must, I must",modern_love
Were it bitter gall.,modern_love
But I shall keep it sweet,modern_love
By some strange art;,modern_love
Wild honey I shall eat,modern_love
When I eat my heart.,modern_love
O honey cool and chaste,modern_love
As clovers breath!,modern_love
Sweet Heaven I shall taste,modern_love
Before my death.When the first dark had fallen around them,modern_love
"Within him, die, and find death good.Supper comes at five o'clock,",modern_love
"At six, the evening star,",modern_love
My lover comes at eight o'clock,modern_love
But eight o'clock is far.,modern_love
How could I bear my pain all day,modern_love
Unless I watched to see,modern_love
The clock-hands laboring to bring,modern_love
"Eight o'clock to me.Go, dumb-born book,",modern_love
Tell her that sang me once that song of Lawes:,modern_love
Hadst thou but song,modern_love
"As thou hast subjects known,",modern_love
Then were there cause in thee that should condone,modern_love
Even my faults that heavy upon me lie,modern_love
And build her glories their longevity.,modern_love
Tell her that sheds,modern_love
"Such treasure in the air,",modern_love
Recking naught else but that her graces give,modern_love
"Life to the moment,",modern_love
I would bid them live,modern_love
"As roses might, in magic amber laid,",modern_love
Red overwrought with orange and all made,modern_love
One substance and one colour,modern_love
Braving time.,modern_love
Tell her that goes,modern_love
With song upon her lips,modern_love
"But sings not out the song, nor knows",modern_love
"The maker of it, some other mouth,",modern_love
"May be as fair as hers,",modern_love
"Might, in new ages, gain her worshippers,",modern_love
"When our two dusts with Wallers shall be laid,",modern_love
"Siftings on siftings in oblivion,",modern_love
Till change hath broken down,modern_love
"All things save Beauty alone.They came to tell your faults to me,",modern_love
They named them over one by one;,modern_love
"I laughed aloud when they were done,",modern_love
"I knew them all so well before, ",modern_love
"Oh, they were blind, too blind to see",modern_love
Your faults had made me love you more.I never knew the earth had so much gold,modern_love
"The fields run over with it, and this hill",modern_love
"Hoary and old,",modern_love
Is young with buoyant blooms that flame and thrill.,modern_love
"Such golden fires, such yellowlo, how good",modern_love
"This spendthrift world, and what a lavish God!",modern_love
"This fringe of wood,",modern_love
Blazing with buttercup and goldenrod.,modern_love
"You too, beloved, are changed. Again I see",modern_love
"Your face grow mystical, as on that night",modern_love
"You turned to me,",modern_love
And all the trembling worldand youwere white.,modern_love
"Aye, you are touched; your singing lips grow dumb;",modern_love
"The fields absorb you, color you entire . . .",modern_love
And you become,modern_love
A goddess standing in a world of fire!When she rises in the morning,modern_love
I linger to watch her;,modern_love
She spreads the bath-cloth underneath the window,modern_love
And the sunbeams catch her,modern_love
"Glistening white on the shoulders,",modern_love
While down her sides the mellow,modern_love
Golden shadow glows as,modern_love
"She stoops to the sponge, and her swung breasts",modern_love
Sway like full-blown yellow,modern_love
Gloire de Dijon roses.,modern_love
"She drips herself with water, and her shoulders",modern_love
"Glisten as silver, they crumple up",modern_love
"Like wet and falling roses, and I listen",modern_love
For the sluicing of their rain-dishevelled petals.,modern_love
In the window full of sunlight,modern_love
Concentrates her golden shadow,modern_love
"Fold on fold, until it glows as",modern_love
Mellow as the glory roses.,modern_love
I have built a house in the middle of the Ocean,modern_nature
Its windows are the rivers flowing from my eyes,modern_nature
Octopi are crawling all over where the walls are,modern_nature
Hear their triple hearts beat and their beaks peck against the windowpanes,modern_nature
House of dampness,modern_nature
House of burning,modern_nature
Seasons fastness,modern_nature
Season singing,modern_nature
The airplanes are laying eggs,modern_nature
Watch out for the dropping of the anchor,modern_nature
Watch out for the shooting black ichor,modern_nature
It would be good if you were to come from the sky,modern_nature
The skys honeysuckle is climbing,modern_nature
The earthly octopi are throbbing,modern_nature
And so very many of us have become our own gravediggers,modern_nature
Pale octopi of the chalky waves O octopi with pale beaks,modern_nature
Around the house is this ocean that you know well,modern_nature
  And is never still,modern_nature
"O sweet everlasting Voices, be still;",modern_nature
Go to the guards of the heavenly fold,modern_nature
"And bid them wander obeying your will,",modern_nature
"Flame under flame, till Time be no more;",modern_nature
"Have you not heard that our hearts are old,",modern_nature
"That you call in birds, in wind on the hill,",modern_nature
"In shaken boughs, in tide on the shore?",modern_nature
"O sweet everlasting Voices, be still. Although you hide in the ebb and flow",modern_nature
"Of the pale tide when the moon has set,",modern_nature
The people of coming days will know,modern_nature
"About the casting out of my net,",modern_nature
And how you have leaped times out of mind,modern_nature
"Over the little silver cords,",modern_nature
"And think that you were hard and unkind,",modern_nature
"And blame you with many bitter words.She that but little patience knew,",modern_nature
"From childhood on, had now so much",modern_nature
A grey gull lost its fear and flew,modern_nature
"Down to her cell and there alit,",modern_nature
And there endured her fingers' touch,modern_nature
And from her fingers ate its bit.,modern_nature
Did she in touching that lone wing,modern_nature
Recall the years before her mind,modern_nature
"Became a bitter, an abstract thing,",modern_nature
Her thought some popular enmity:,modern_nature
Blind and leader of the blind,modern_nature
Drinking the foul ditch where they lie?,modern_nature
When long ago I saw her ride,modern_nature
"Under Ben Bulben to the meet,",modern_nature
The beauty of her country-side,modern_nature
"With all youth's lonely wildness stirred,",modern_nature
She seemed to have grown clean and sweet,modern_nature
"Like any rock-bred, sea-borne bird:",modern_nature
"Sea-borne, or balanced in the air",modern_nature
When first it sprang out of the nest,modern_nature
Upon some lofty rock to stare,modern_nature
"Upon the cloudy canopy,",modern_nature
While under its storm-beaten breast,modern_nature
"Cried out the hollows of the sea.There was a man whom Sorrow named his friend,",modern_nature
"And he, of his high comrade Sorrow dreaming,",modern_nature
Went walking with slow steps along the gleaming,modern_nature
"And humming sands, where windy surges wend:",modern_nature
And he called loudly to the stars to bend,modern_nature
"From their pale thrones and comfort him, but they",modern_nature
Among themselves laugh on and sing alway:,modern_nature
And then the man whom Sorrow named his friend,modern_nature
"Cried out, Dim sea, hear my most piteous story!",modern_nature
"The sea swept on and cried her old cry still,",modern_nature
Rolling along in dreams from hill to hill.,modern_nature
He fled the persecution of her glory,modern_nature
"And, in a far-off, gentle valley stopping,",modern_nature
Cried all his story to the dewdrops glistening.,modern_nature
"But naught they heard, for they are always listening,",modern_nature
"The dewdrops, for the sound of their own dropping.",modern_nature
And then the man whom Sorrow named his friend,modern_nature
"Sought once again the shore, and found a shell,",modern_nature
"And thought, I will my heavy story tell",modern_nature
"Till my own words, re-echoing, shall send",modern_nature
"Their sadness through a hollow, pearly heart;",modern_nature
"And my own tale again for me shall sing,",modern_nature
"And my own whispering words be comforting,",modern_nature
And lo! my ancient burden may depart.,modern_nature
Then he sang softly nigh the pearly rim;,modern_nature
But the sad dweller by the sea-ways lone,modern_nature
Changed all he sang to inarticulate moan,modern_nature
"Among her wildering whirls, forgetting him. The woods of Arcady are dead,",modern_nature
And over is their antique joy;,modern_nature
Of old the world on dreaming fed;,modern_nature
Grey Truth is now her painted toy;,modern_nature
Yet still she turns her restless head:,modern_nature
"But O, sick children of the world,",modern_nature
Of all the many changing things,modern_nature
"In dreary dancing past us whirled,",modern_nature
"To the cracked tune that Chronos sings,",modern_nature
Words alone are certain good.,modern_nature
"Where are now the warring kings,",modern_nature
Word be-mockers?  By the Rood,modern_nature
Where are now the warring kings?,modern_nature
"An idle word is now their glory,",modern_nature
"By the stammering schoolboy said,",modern_nature
Reading some entangled story:,modern_nature
The kings of the old time are dead;,modern_nature
The wandering earth herself may be,modern_nature
"Only a sudden flaming word,",modern_nature
"In clanging space a moment heard,",modern_nature
Troubling the endless reverie.,modern_nature
"Then nowise worship dusty deeds,",modern_nature
"Nor seek, for this is also sooth,",modern_nature
"To hunger fiercely after truth,",modern_nature
Lest all thy toiling only breeds,modern_nature
"New dreams, new dreams; there is no truth",modern_nature
"Saving in thine own heart. Seek, then,",modern_nature
"No learning from the starry men,",modern_nature
Who follow with the optic glass,modern_nature
The whirling ways of stars that pass  ,modern_nature
"Seek, then, for this is also sooth,",modern_nature
No word of theirs  the cold star-bane,modern_nature
"Has cloven and rent their hearts in twain,",modern_nature
And dead is all their human truth.,modern_nature
Go gather by the humming sea,modern_nature
"Some twisted, echo-harbouring shell,",modern_nature
"And to its lips thy story tell,",modern_nature
"And they thy comforters will be,",modern_nature
Rewarding in melodious guile,modern_nature
"Thy fretful words a little while,",modern_nature
Till they shall singing fade in ruth,modern_nature
And die a pearly brotherhood;,modern_nature
For words alone are certain good:,modern_nature
"Sing, then, for this is also sooth.",modern_nature
I must be gone: there is a grave,modern_nature
"Where daffodil and lily wave,",modern_nature
"And I would please the hapless faun,",modern_nature
"Buried under the sleepy ground,",modern_nature
With mirthful songs before the dawn.,modern_nature
His shouting days with mirth were crowned;,modern_nature
"And still I dream he treads the lawn,",modern_nature
"Walking ghostly in the dew,",modern_nature
"Pierced by my glad singing through,",modern_nature
My songs of old earth's dreamy youth:,modern_nature
But ah! she dreams not now; dream thou!,modern_nature
For fair are poppies on the brow:,modern_nature
"Dream, dream, for this is also sooth.",modern_nature
There is a wolf in me . . . fangs pointed for tearing gashes . . . a red tongue for raw meat . . . and the hot lapping of bloodI keep this wolf because the wilderness gave it to me and the wilderness will not let it go.    ,modern_nature
There is a fox in me . . . a silver-gray fox . . . I sniff and guess . . . I pick things out of the wind and air . . . I nose in the dark night and take sleepers and eat them and hide the feathers . . . I circle and loop and double-cross.,modern_nature

"There is an eagle in me and a mockingbird . . . and the eagle flies among the Rocky Mountains of my dreams and fights among the Sierra crags of what I want . . . and the mockingbird warbles in the early forenoon before the dew is gone, warbles in the underbrush of my Chattanoogas of hope, gushes over the blue Ozark foothills of my wishesAnd I got the eagle and the mockingbird from the wilderness.",modern_nature
"O, I got a zoo, I got a menagerie, inside my ribs, under my bony head, under my red-valve heartand I got something else: it is a man-child heart, a woman-child heart: it is a father and mother and lover: it came from God-Knows-Where: it is going to God-Knows-WhereFor I am the keeper of the zoo: I say yes and no: I sing and kill and work: I am a pal of the world: I came from the wilderness.",modern_nature
Perspective never withers from their eyes;   ,modern_nature
They keep that docile edict of the Spring,modern_nature
That blends March with August Antarctic skies:   ,modern_nature
These are but cows that see no other thing   ,modern_nature
"Than grass and snow, and their own inner being   ",modern_nature
Through the rich halo that they do not trouble   ,modern_nature
Even to cast upon the seasons fleeting,modern_nature
Though they should thin and die on last years stubble.,modern_nature
"And they are awkward, ponderous and uncoy . . .   ",modern_nature
"While we who press the cider mill, regarding them",modern_nature
"We, who with pledges taste the bright annoy   ",modern_nature
"Of friendships acid wine, retarding phlegm,",modern_nature
Shifting reprisals (til who shall tell us when,modern_nature

I was the first fruits of the battle of Missionary Ridge.,modern_mythology_folklore
When I felt the bullet enter my heart,modern_mythology_folklore
I wished I had staid at home and gone to jail,modern_mythology_folklore
"For stealing the hogs of Curl Trenary,",modern_mythology_folklore
Instead of running away and joining the army.,modern_mythology_folklore
Rather a thousand times the county jail,modern_mythology_folklore
"Than to lie under this marble figure with wings,",modern_mythology_folklore
"And this granite pedestal Bearing the words, Pro Patria.",modern_mythology_folklore
I was only eight years old;,modern_mythology_folklore
And before I grew up and knew what it meant,modern_mythology_folklore
"I had no words for it, except",modern_mythology_folklore
That I was frightened and told my,modern_mythology_folklore
Mother; And that my Father got a pistol,modern_mythology_folklore
"And would have killed Charlie, who was a big boy,",modern_mythology_folklore
"Fifteen years old, except for his Mother.",modern_mythology_folklore

"In the name of God, ",modern_mythology_folklore
How could they do it? ,modern_mythology_folklore
Those souls that usually dived ,modern_mythology_folklore

"In the name of God, how could they do it? ",modern_mythology_folklore
"For there is no new thing under the sun, ",modern_mythology_folklore
Only this uncomely man with a smoking gun ,modern_mythology_folklore
In the gloom. . . ,modern_mythology_folklore
What the devil will he gain by it? ,modern_mythology_folklore
Digging a hole in the mud and standing all day in the rain by it ,modern_mythology_folklore
Waiting his doom; ,modern_mythology_folklore
"The sharp blow, the swift outpouring of the blood, ",modern_mythology_folklore
Till the trench of gray mud ,modern_mythology_folklore
Is turned to a brown purple drain by it. ,modern_mythology_folklore
"Well, there have been scars ",modern_mythology_folklore
Won in many wars . . .,modern_mythology_folklore
"Punic, ",modern_mythology_folklore
"Lacedmonian, wars of Napoleon, wars for faith, wars for honour, for love, for possession, ",modern_mythology_folklore
"But this Belgian man in his ugly tunic, ",modern_mythology_folklore
"His ugly round cap, shooting on, in a sort of obsession, ",modern_mythology_folklore
"Overspreading his miserable land, ",modern_mythology_folklore
Standing with his wet gun in his hand . . . ,modern_mythology_folklore
Doom! ,modern_mythology_folklore
"He finds that in a sudden scrimmage, ",modern_mythology_folklore
"And lies, an unsightly lump on the sodden grass . . . ",modern_mythology_folklore
An image that shall take long to pass! ,modern_mythology_folklore
For the white-limbed heroes of Hellas ride by upon their horses ,modern_mythology_folklore
Forever through our brains. ,modern_mythology_folklore
The heroes of Cressy ride by upon their stallions; ,modern_mythology_folklore
And battalions and battalions and battalions ,modern_mythology_folklore
"The Old Guard, the Young Guard, the men of Minden and of Waterloo, ",modern_mythology_folklore
"Pass, for ever staunch, ",modern_mythology_folklore
"Stand, for ever true; ",modern_mythology_folklore
"And the small man with the large paunch, ",modern_mythology_folklore
"And the gray coat, and the large hat, and the hands behind the back, ",modern_mythology_folklore
Watches them pass ,modern_mythology_folklore
In our minds for ever . . . ,modern_mythology_folklore
But that clutter of sodden corses ,modern_mythology_folklore
On the sodden Belgian grass ,modern_mythology_folklore
That is a strange new beauty. ,modern_mythology_folklore
"With no especial legends of marchings or triumphs or duty, ",modern_mythology_folklore
"Assuredly that is the way of it, ",modern_mythology_folklore
The way of beauty . . . ,modern_mythology_folklore
And that is the highest word you can find to say of it. ,modern_mythology_folklore
For you cannot praise it with words ,modern_mythology_folklore
"Compounded of lyres and swords, ",modern_mythology_folklore
But the thought of the gloom and the rain ,modern_mythology_folklore
"And the ugly coated figure, standing beside a drain, ",modern_mythology_folklore
Shall eat itself into your brain: ,modern_mythology_folklore
"And you will say of all heroes, They fought like the Belgians! ",modern_mythology_folklore
And you will say: He wrought like a Belgian his fate out of gloom. ,modern_mythology_folklore
And you will say: He bought like a Belgian his doom. ,modern_mythology_folklore
And that shall be an honourable name; ,modern_mythology_folklore
Belgian shall be an honourable word; ,modern_mythology_folklore
"As honourable as the fame of the sword, ",modern_mythology_folklore
"As honourable as the mention of the many-chorded lyre, ",modern_mythology_folklore
And his old coat shall seem as beautiful as the fabrics woven in Tyre. ,modern_mythology_folklore
And what in the world did they bear it for? ,modern_mythology_folklore
I don't know. ,modern_mythology_folklore
And what in the world did they dare it for? ,modern_mythology_folklore
Perhaps that is not for the likes of me to understand. ,modern_mythology_folklore
They could very well have watched a hundred legions go ,modern_mythology_folklore
Over their fields and between their cities ,modern_mythology_folklore
Down into more southerly regions. ,modern_mythology_folklore
"They could very well have let the legions pass through their woods, ",modern_mythology_folklore
And have kept their lives and their wives and their children and cattle and goods. ,modern_mythology_folklore
I don't understand. ,modern_mythology_folklore
Was it just love of their land? ,modern_mythology_folklore
"Oh, poor dears! ",modern_mythology_folklore
Can any man so love his land? ,modern_mythology_folklore
Give them a thousand thousand pities ,modern_mythology_folklore
And rivers and rivers of tears ,modern_mythology_folklore
To wash off the blood from the cities of Flanders. ,modern_mythology_folklore
This is Charing Cross; ,modern_mythology_folklore
It is midnight; ,modern_mythology_folklore
There is a great crowd ,modern_mythology_folklore
And no light. ,modern_mythology_folklore
"A great crowd, all black that hardly whispers aloud. ",modern_mythology_folklore
"Surely, that is a dead womana dead mother! ",modern_mythology_folklore
She has a dead face; ,modern_mythology_folklore
She is dressed all in black; ,modern_mythology_folklore
"She wanders to the bookstall and back, ",modern_mythology_folklore
At the back of the crowd; ,modern_mythology_folklore
"And back again and again back, ",modern_mythology_folklore
She sways and wanders. ,modern_mythology_folklore
This is Charing Cross; ,modern_mythology_folklore
It is one o'clock. ,modern_mythology_folklore
"There is still a great cloud, and very little light; ",modern_mythology_folklore
Immense shafts of shadows over the black crowd ,modern_mythology_folklore
That hardly whispers aloud. . . ,modern_mythology_folklore
"And now! .  . That is another dead mother, ",modern_mythology_folklore
And there is another and another and another. . . ,modern_mythology_folklore
"And little children, all in black, ",modern_mythology_folklore
"All with dead faces, waiting in all the waiting-places, ",modern_mythology_folklore
Wandering from the doors of the waiting-room ,modern_mythology_folklore
In the dim gloom. ,modern_mythology_folklore
These are the women of Flanders.,modern_mythology_folklore
They await the lost. ,modern_mythology_folklore
They await the lost that shall never leave the dock; ,modern_mythology_folklore
They await the lost that shall never again come by the train ,modern_mythology_folklore
To the embraces of all these women with dead faces; ,modern_mythology_folklore
"They await the lost who lie dead in trench and barrier and foss, ",modern_mythology_folklore
In the dark of the night. ,modern_mythology_folklore
This is Charing Cross; it is past one of the clock; ,modern_mythology_folklore
There is very little light. ,modern_mythology_folklore
There is so much pain. ,modern_mythology_folklore
And it was for this that they endured this gloom; ,modern_mythology_folklore
"This October like November, ",modern_mythology_folklore
"That August like a hundred thousand hours, ",modern_mythology_folklore
"And that September, ",modern_mythology_folklore
"A hundred thousand dragging sunlit days, ",modern_mythology_folklore
And half October like a thousand years. . . ,modern_mythology_folklore
"Now, youth, the hour of thy dread passion comes;",modern_mythology_folklore
Thy lovely things must all be laid away;,modern_mythology_folklore
"And thou, as others, must face the riven day",modern_mythology_folklore
"Unstirred by rattle of the rolling drums,",modern_mythology_folklore
Or bugles' strident cry. When mere noise numbs,modern_mythology_folklore
"The sense of being, the sick soul doth sway,",modern_mythology_folklore
"Remember thy great craft's honour, that they may say",modern_mythology_folklore
Nothing in shame of poets. Then the crumbs,modern_mythology_folklore
Of praise the little versemen joyed to take,modern_mythology_folklore
"Shall be forgotten; then they must know we are,",modern_mythology_folklore
"For all our skill in words, equal in might",modern_mythology_folklore
And strong of mettle as those we honoured; make,modern_mythology_folklore
"The name of poet terrible in just war,",modern_mythology_folklore
And like a crown of honour upon the fight.,modern_mythology_folklore
My bands of silk and miniver,modern_mythology_folklore
Momently grew heavier;,modern_mythology_folklore
The black gauze was beggarly thin;,modern_mythology_folklore
The ermine muffled mouth and chin;,modern_mythology_folklore
I could not suck the moonlight in.,modern_mythology_folklore
Harlequin in lozenges,modern_mythology_folklore
"Of love and hate, I walked in these",modern_mythology_folklore
Striped and ragged rigmaroles;,modern_mythology_folklore
Along the pavement my footsoles,modern_mythology_folklore
Trod warily on living coals.,modern_mythology_folklore
"Shouldering the thoughts I loathed,",modern_mythology_folklore
"In their corrupt disguises clothed,",modern_mythology_folklore
Morality I could not tear,modern_mythology_folklore
"From my ribs, to leave them bare",modern_mythology_folklore
Ivory in silver air.,modern_mythology_folklore
"There I walked, and there I raged;",modern_mythology_folklore
The spiritual savage caged,modern_mythology_folklore
"Within my skeleton, raged afresh",modern_mythology_folklore
"To feel, behind a carnal mesh,",modern_mythology_folklore
The clean bones crying in the flesh.,modern_mythology_folklore
"Behoild Pelides with his yellow hair,",modern_mythology_folklore
"Proud child of Thetis, hero loved of Jove;",modern_mythology_folklore
Above the frowning of his brows of wove,modern_mythology_folklore
"A crown of gold, well combed, with Spartan care.",modern_mythology_folklore
"Who might have seen him, sullen, great, and fair,",modern_mythology_folklore
"As with the wrongful world he proudly strove,",modern_mythology_folklore
"And by high deeds his wilder passion shrove,",modern_mythology_folklore
"Mastering love, resentment, and despair.",modern_mythology_folklore
"He knew his end, and Phoebus arrow sure",modern_mythology_folklore
"He braved for fame immortal and a friend,",modern_mythology_folklore
"Despising life; and we, who know our end,",modern_mythology_folklore
Know that in our decay he shall endure,modern_mythology_folklore

With whose first bitter battles his shall blend.,modern_mythology_folklore
"Who brought thee forth, immortal vision, who",modern_mythology_folklore
In Phthia or in Tempe brought thee forth?,modern_mythology_folklore
Out of the sunlight and the sapful earth,modern_mythology_folklore
What god the simples of thy spirit drew?,modern_mythology_folklore
"A goddess rose from the green waves, and threw",modern_mythology_folklore
"Her arms about a king, to give thee birth;",modern_mythology_folklore
"A centaur, patron of thy boyish mirth,",modern_mythology_folklore
Over the meadows in thy footsteps flew.,modern_mythology_folklore
"Now Thessaly forgets thee, and the deep",modern_mythology_folklore
Thy keeled bark furrowed answers not thy prayer;,modern_mythology_folklore
But far away new generations keep,modern_mythology_folklore
Thy laurels fresh; where branching Isis hems,modern_mythology_folklore
"The lawns of Oxford round about, or where",modern_mythology_folklore
Enchanted Eton sits by pleasant Thames.,modern_mythology_folklore
I gaze on thee as Phidias of old,modern_mythology_folklore
"Or Polyclitus gazed, when first he saw",modern_mythology_folklore
"These hard and shining limbs, without a flaw,",modern_mythology_folklore
And cast his wonder in heroic mould.,modern_mythology_folklore
"Unhappy me who only may behold,",modern_mythology_folklore
Nor make immutable and fix in awe,modern_mythology_folklore

A tempered mind whose faith was never told!,modern_mythology_folklore
"The godlike mien, the lions lock and eye,",modern_mythology_folklore

Better than many words that part by part,modern_mythology_folklore

"Two distincts, division none:",renaissance_love
Number there in love was slain.,renaissance_love
"Hearts remote, yet not asunder;",renaissance_love
Distance and no space was seen,renaissance_love
'Twixt this Turtle and his queen:,renaissance_love

So between them love did shine,renaissance_love
That the Turtle saw his right,renaissance_love
Flaming in the Phoenix' sight:,renaissance_love
Either was the other's mine.,renaissance_love
Property was thus appalled,renaissance_love
That the self was not the same;,renaissance_love
Single nature's double name,renaissance_love
Neither two nor one was called.,renaissance_love
"Reason, in itself confounded,",renaissance_love

Simple were so well compounded;,renaissance_love
"That it cried, How true a twain",renaissance_love
Seemeth this concordant one!,renaissance_love
"Love has reason, reason none,",renaissance_love
If what parts can so remain.,renaissance_love
Whereupon it made this threne,renaissance_love

"Co-supremes and stars of love,",renaissance_love
As chorus to their tragic scene:,renaissance_love
"Beauty, truth, and rarity,",renaissance_love

Leaving no posterity:,renaissance_love

Is more than my oerpressed defense can bide?,renaissance_love
"Let me excuse thee: ah, my love well knows",renaissance_love
Her pretty looks have been mine enemies;,renaissance_love

Kill me outright with looks and rid my pain.,renaissance_love
"Love is my sin, and thy dear virtue hate,",renaissance_love

"O, but with mine compare thou thine own state,",renaissance_love
And thou shalt find it merits not reproving;,renaissance_love
"Or if it do, not from those lips of thine,",renaissance_love
That have profaned their scarlet ornaments,renaissance_love
"And sealed false bonds of love as oft as mine,",renaissance_love
Robbed others beds revenues of their rents.,renaissance_love
Be it lawful I love thee as thou lovst those,renaissance_love
Whom thine eyes woo as mine importune thee:,renaissance_love

Busily seeking with a continual change.,renaissance_love
Thanked be fortune it hath been otherwise,renaissance_love
"Twenty times better; but once, in special,",renaissance_love

"And softly said, Dear heart, how like you this?",renaissance_love
It was no dream: I lay broad waking:,renaissance_love

Into a strange fashion of forsaking;,renaissance_love

As there had been none such.,renaissance_love
My Muse doth not delight,renaissance_love
Me as she did before;,renaissance_love
