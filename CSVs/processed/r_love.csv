The day before Curl Trenary,neg
Swore out a warrant through Justice Arnett,neg
For stealing hogs.,neg
But that's not the reason he turned a soldier.,neg
He caught me running with Lucius Atherton.,neg
We quarreled and I told him never again,neg
To cross my path.,neg
Then he stole the hogs and went to the war,neg
Back of every soldier is a woman.He protested all his life long,neg
The newspapers lied about him villainously;,neg
"That he was not at fault for Minerva's fall,",neg
But only tried to help her.,neg
Poor soul so sunk in sin he could not see,neg
"That even trying to help her, as he called it,",neg
He had broken the law human and divine.,neg
"Passers by, an ancient admonition to you:",neg
"If your ways would be ways of pleasantness,",neg
"And all your pathways peace,",neg
Love God and keep his commandments.,neg
"And lights were paling out of the West,",neg
"You would come hither, and bend your head,",neg
And I would lay my head on your breast;,neg
"And you would murmur tender words,",neg
"Forgiving me, because you were dead:",neg
"Nor would you rise and hasten away,",neg
"Though you have the will of wild birds,",neg
But know your hair was bound and wound,neg
About the stars and moon and sun:,neg
"O would, beloved, that you lay",neg
"Under the dock-leaves in the ground,",neg
"While lights were paling one by one.Never give all the heart, for love",neg
Will hardly seem worth thinking of,neg
To passionate women if it seem,neg
"Certain, and they never dream",neg
That it fades out from kiss to kiss;,neg
For everything thats lovely is,neg
"But a brief, dreamy, kind delight.",neg
"O never give the heart outright,",neg
"For they, for all smooth lips can say,",neg
Have given their hearts up to the play.,neg
And who could play it well enough,neg
If deaf and dumb and blind with love?,neg
"He that made this knows all the cost,",neg
For he gave all his heart and lost.Why should I blame her that she filled my days,neg
"With misery, or that she would of late",neg
"Have taught to ignorant men most violent ways,",neg
"Or hurled the little streets upon the great,",neg
Had they but courage equal to desire?,neg
What could have made her peaceful with a mind,neg
"That nobleness made simple as a fire,",neg
"With beauty like a tightened bow, a kind",neg
"That is not natural in an age like this,",neg
Being high and solitary and most stern?,neg
"Why, what could she have done, being what she is?",neg
Was there another Troy for her to burn?Some may have blamed you that you took away,neg
The verses that could move them on the day,neg
"When, the ears being deafened, the sight of the eyes blind",neg
"With lightning, you went from me, and I could find",neg
"Nothing to make a song about but kings,",neg
"Helmets, and swords, and half-forgotten things",neg
That were like memories of youbut now,neg
"We'll out, for the world lives as long ago;",neg
"And while we're in our laughing, weeping fit,",neg
"Hurl helmets, crowns, and swords into the pit.",neg
"But, dear, cling close to me; since you were gone,",neg
"My barren thoughts have chilled me to the bone. Shy one, shy one,",neg
"Shy one of my heart,",neg
She moves in the firelight,neg
Pensively apart.,neg
"She carries in the dishes,",neg
And lays them in a row.,neg
To an isle in the water,neg
With her would I go.,neg
"She carries in the candles,",neg
"And lights the curtained room,",neg
Shy in the doorway,neg
And shy in the gloom;,neg
"And shy as a rabbit,",neg
Helpful and shy.,neg
To an isle in the water,neg
"With her would I fly.I feel the spring far off, far off,",neg
"The faint, far scent of bud and leaf",neg
"Oh, how can spring take heart to come",neg
"To a world in grief,",neg
Deep grief?,neg
"The sun turns north, the days grow long,",neg
Later the evening star grows bright,neg
How can the daylight linger on,neg
"For men to fight,",neg
Still fight?,neg
"The grass is waking in the ground,",neg
Soon it will rise and blow in waves,neg
How can it have the heart to sway,neg
"Over the graves,",neg
New graves?,neg
Under the boughs where lovers walked,neg
The apple-blooms will shed their breath,neg
But what of all the lovers now,neg
"Parted by Death,",neg
"Grey Death?Lying in dug-outs, joking idly, wearily;",neg
Watching the candle guttering in the draught;,neg
"Hearing the great shells go high over us, eerily",neg
"Singing; how often have I turned over, and laughed",neg
"With pity and pride, photographs of all colours,",neg
"All sizes, subjects: khaki brothers in France;",neg
Or mother's faces worn with countless dolours;,neg
"Or girls whose eyes were challenging and must dance,",neg
"Though in a picture only, a common cheap",neg
"Ill-taken card; and childrenfrozen, some",neg
waiting on Dicky-bird to peep,neg
Out of the handkerchief that is his home,neg
"But he's so shy! And some with bright looks, calling",neg
"Delight across the miles of land and sea,",neg
That not the dread of barrage suddenly falling,neg
Could quite blot outnot mud nor lethargy.,neg
Smiles and triumphant careless laughter. O,neg
"The pain of them, wide Earth's most sacred things! ",neg
"Lying in dug-outs, hearing the great shells slow",neg
"Sailing mile-high, the heart mounts higher and sings.",neg
But onceO why did he keep that bitter token,neg
"Of a dead Love?that boy, who, suddenly moved,",neg
"Showed me, his eyes wet, his low talk broken,",neg
"A girl who better had not been beloved.I went out to the hazel wood,",neg
"Because a fire was in my head,",neg
"And cut and peeled a hazel wand,",neg
And hooked a berry to a thread;,neg
"And when white moths were on the wing,",neg
"And moth-like stars were flickering out,",neg
I dropped the berry in a stream,neg
And caught a little silver trout.,neg
When I had laid it on the floor,neg
"I went to blow the fire a-flame,",neg
"But something rustled on the floor,",neg
And someone called me by my name:,neg
It had become a glimmering girl,neg
With apple blossom in her hair,neg
Who called me by my name and ran,neg
And faded through the brightening air.,neg
Though I am old with wandering,neg
"Through hollow lands and hilly lands,",neg
"I will find out where she has gone,",neg
And kiss her lips and take her hands;,neg
"And walk among long dappled grass,",neg
"And pluck till time and times are done,",neg
"The silver apples of the moon,",neg
The golden apples of the sun.Now that I know,neg
That passion warms little,neg
"Of flesh in the mold,",neg
"And treasure is brittle,",neg
Ill lie here and learn,neg
"How, over their ground,",neg
Trees make a long shadow,neg
And a light sound.,neg
"The stars are hiding now,",neg
"And frowning on the world, love,",neg
Night bares her sable brow.,neg
"The snow is on the ground, love,",neg
And cold and keen the air is.,neg
"Im singing here to you, love;",neg
Youre dreaming there in Paris.,neg
"But this is Natures law, love,",neg
"Though just it may not seem,",neg
"That men should wake to sing, love;",neg
While maidens sleep and dream.,neg
"Them care may not molest, love,",neg
"Nor stir them from their slumbers,",neg
"Though midnight find the swain, love.",neg
Still halting oer his numbers.,neg
"I watch the rosy dawn, love,",neg
"Come stealing up the east,",neg
"While all things round rejoice, love,",neg
That Night her reign has ceased.,neg
"The lark will soon be heard, love,",neg
And on his way be winging;,neg
"When Natures poets, wake, love,",neg
"Why should a man be singing?Thou art my lute, by thee I sing,",neg
My being is attuned to thee.,neg
"Thou settest all my words a-wing,",neg
And meltest me to melody.,neg
"Thou art my life, by thee I live,",neg
From thee proceed the joys I know;,neg
"Sweetheart, thy hand has power to give",neg
The meed of lovethe cup of woe.,neg
"Thou art my love, by thee I lead",neg
"My soul the paths of light along,",neg
"From vale to vale, from mead to mead,",neg
And home it in the hills of song.,neg
"My song, my soul, my life, my all,",neg
"Why need I pray or make my plea,",neg
Since my petition cannot fall;,neg
For Im already one with thee!Wine comes in at the mouth,neg
And love comes in at the eye;,neg
Thats all we shall know for truth,neg
Before we grow old and die.,neg
"I lift the glass to my mouth,",neg
"I look at you, and I sigh.Bilbea, I was in Babylon on Saturday night.",neg
I saw nothing of you anywhere.,neg
"I was at the old place and the other girls were there,",neg
But no Bilbea.,neg
Have you gone to another house? or city?,neg
Why dont you write?,neg
I was sorry. I walked home half-sick.,neg
Tell me how it goes.,neg
Send me some kind of a letter.,neg
"And take care of yourself.How much do you love me, a million bushels?",neg
"Oh, a lot more than that, Oh, a lot more.",neg
And tomorrow maybe only half a bushel?,neg
Tomorrow maybe not even a half a bushel.,neg
And is this your heart arithmetic?,neg
This is the way the wind measures the weather.,neg
When the world turns completely upside down,neg
You say well emigrate to the Eastern Shore,neg
Aboard a river-boat from Baltimore;,neg
"Well live among wild peach trees, miles from town,",neg
"Youll wear a coonskin cap, and I a gown",neg
"Homespun, dyed butternuts dark gold color.",neg
"Lost, like your lotus-eating ancestor,",neg
Well swim in milk and honey till we drown.,neg
"The winter will be short, the summer long,",neg
"The autumn amber-hued, sunny and hot,",neg
Tasting of cider and of scuppernong;,neg
"All seasons sweet, but autumn best of all.",neg
The squirrels in their silver fur will fall,neg
"Like falling leaves, like fruit, before your shot.",neg
The autumn frosts will lie upon the grass,neg
Like bloom on grapes of purple-brown and gold.,neg
The misted early mornings will be cold;,neg
The little puddles will be roofed with glass.,neg
"The sun, which burns from copper into brass,",neg
"Melts these at noon, and makes the boys unfold",neg
Their knitted mufflers; full as they can hold,neg
Fat pockets dribble chestnuts as they pass.,neg
"Peaches grow wild, and pigs can live in clover;",neg
A barrel of salted herrings lasts a year;,neg
The spring begins before the winters over.,neg
By February you may find the skins,neg
Of garter snakes and water moccasins,neg
"Dwindled and harsh, dead-white and cloudy-clear.",neg
When April pours the colors of a shell,neg
"Upon the hills, when every little creek",neg
Is shot with silver from the Chesapeake,neg
"In shoals new-minted by the ocean swell,",neg
"When strawberries go begging, and the sleek",neg
"Blue plums lie open to the blackbirds beak,",neg
We shall live well  we shall live very well.,neg
The months between the cherries and the peaches,neg
Are brimming cornucopias which spill,neg
"Fruits red and purple, sombre-bloomed and black;",neg
"Then, down rich fields and frosty river beaches",neg
"Well trample bright persimmons, while you kill",neg
"Bronze partridge, speckled quail, and canvasback.",neg
Down to the Puritan marrow of my bones,neg
Theres something in this richness that I hate.,neg
"I love the look, austere, immaculate,",neg
Of landscapes drawn in pearly monotones.,neg
Theres something in my very blood that owns,neg
"Bare hills, cold silver on a sky of slate,",neg
"A thread of water, churned to milky spate",neg
Streaming through slanted pastures fenced with stones.,neg
"I love those skies, thin blue or snowy gray,",neg
"Those fields sparse-planted, rendering meagre sheaves;",neg
"That spring, briefer than apple-blossoms breath,",neg
"Summer, so much too beautiful to stay,",neg
"Swift autumn, like a bonfire of leaves,",neg
"And sleepy winter, like the sleep of death.",neg
"The eyes of the very learned British Museum assistant.We sat together at one summers end,",neg
"That beautiful mild woman, your close friend,   ",neg
"And you and I, and talked of poetry.",neg
"I said, A line will take us hours maybe;",neg
"Yet if it does not seem a moments thought,   ",neg
Our stitching and unstitching has been naught.   ,neg
Better go down upon your marrow-bones   ,neg
"And scrub a kitchen pavement, or break stones   ",neg
"Like an old pauper, in all kinds of weather;   ",neg
For to articulate sweet sounds together,neg
"Is to work harder than all these, and yet   ",neg
Be thought an idler by the noisy set,neg
"Of bankers, schoolmasters, and clergymen   ",neg
The martyrs call the world.,neg
That beautiful mild woman for whose sake   ,neg
Theres many a one shall find out all heartache   ,neg
On finding that her voice is sweet and low   ,neg
"Replied, To be born woman is to know",neg
Although they do not talk of it at school,neg
That we must labour to be beautiful.,neg
"I said, Its certain there is no fine thing   ",neg
Since Adams fall but needs much labouring.,neg
There have been lovers who thought love should be   ,neg
So much compounded of high courtesy   ,neg
That they would sigh and quote with learned looks   ,neg
Precedents out of beautiful old books;   ,neg
Yet now it seems an idle trade enough.,neg
We sat grown quiet at the name of love;   ,neg
"We saw the last embers of daylight die,   ",neg
And in the trembling blue-green of the sky   ,neg
"A moon, worn as if it had been a shell   ",neg
Washed by times waters as they rose and fell   ,neg
About the stars and broke in days and years.,neg
I had a thought for no ones but your ears:   ,neg
"That you were beautiful, and that I strove   ",neg
To love you in the old high way of love;,neg
"That it had all seemed happy, and yet wed grown   ",neg
"As weary-hearted as that hollow moon.I wanted you, nameless Woman of the South,",neg
"No wraith, but utterlyas still more alone",neg
The Southern Cross takes night,neg
"And lifts her girdles from her, one by one",neg
"High, cool,",neg
wide from the slowly smoldering fire,neg
"Of lower heavens,",neg
vaporous scars!,neg
Eve! Magdalene!,neg
"or Mary, you?",neg
Whatever callfalls vainly on the wave.,neg
"O simian Venus, homeless Eve,",neg
"Unwedded, stumbling gardenless to grieve",neg
Windswept guitars on lonely decks forever;,neg
Finally to answer all within one grave!,neg
"And this long wake of phosphor,",neg
Furrow of all our traveltrailed derision!,neg
Eyes crumble at its kiss. Its long-drawn spell,neg
Incites a yell. Slid on that backward vision,neg
"The mind is churned to spittle, whispering hell.",neg
I wanted you . . . The embers of the Cross,neg
Climbed by aslant and huddling aromatically.,neg
It is blood to remember; it is fire,neg
To stammer back . . . It is,neg
Godyour namelessness. And the wash,neg
All night the water combed you with black,neg
"Insolence. You crept out simmering, accomplished.",neg
"Water rattled that stinging coil, your",neg
"Rehearsed hairdocile, alas, from many arms.",neg
"Yes, Evewraith of my unloved seed!",neg
"The Cross, a phantom, buckleddropped below the dawn.",neg
Light drowned the lithic trillions of your spawn.,neg
my love and I did meet;,neg
She passed the salley gardens,neg
with little snow-white feet.,neg
"She bid me take love easy,",neg
as the leaves grow on the tree;,neg
"But I, being young and foolish,",neg
with her would not agree.,neg
In a field by the river,neg
"my love and I did stand,",neg
And on my leaning shoulder,neg
she laid her snow-white hand.,neg
"She bid me take life easy,",neg
as the grass grows on the weirs;,neg
"But I was young and foolish,",neg
and now am full of tears.,neg
"You dweller in the dark cabin,",neg
"To whom the watermelon is always purple,   ",neg
"Whose garden is wind and moon,",neg
"Of the two dreams, night and day,",neg
"What lover, what dreamer, would choose   ",neg
The one obscured by sleep?,neg
Here is the plantain by your door   ,neg
And the best cock of red feather   ,neg
That crew before the clocks.,neg
"A feme may come, leaf-green,   ",neg
Whose coming may give revel   ,neg
"Beyond revelries of sleep,",neg
"Yes, and the blackbird spread its tail,   ",neg
"So that the sun may speckle,   ",neg
While it creaks hail.,neg
"You dweller in the dark cabin,   ",neg
"Rise, since rising will not waken,   ",neg
"And hail, cry hail, cry hail.",neg
Come when the nights are bright with stars,neg
Or come when the moon is mellow;,neg
Come when the sun his golden bars,neg
Drops on the hay-field yellow.,neg
"Come in the twilight soft and gray,",neg
"Come in the night or come in the day,",neg
"Come, O love, wheneer you may,",neg
"And you are welcome, welcome.",neg
"You are sweet, O Love, dear Love,",neg
You are soft as the nesting dove.,neg
Come to my heart and bring it to rest,neg
As the bird flies home to its welcome nest.,neg
Come when my heart is full of grief,neg
Or when my heart is merry;,neg
Come with the falling of the leaf,neg
Or with the reddning cherry.,neg
"Come when the years first blossom blows,",neg
"Come when the summer gleams and glows,",neg
"Come with the winters drifting snows,",neg
"And you are welcome, welcome.",neg
While my hair was still cut straight across my forehead,neg
"I played about the front gate, pulling flowers.",neg
"You came by on bamboo stilts, playing horse,",neg
"You walked about my seat, playing with blue plums.",neg
And we went on living in the village of Chokan:,neg
"Two small people, without dislike or suspicion.",neg
At fourteen I married My Lord you.,neg
"I never laughed, being bashful.",neg
"Lowering my head, I looked at the wall.",neg
"Called to, a thousand times, I never looked back.",neg
"At fifteen I stopped scowling,",neg
I desired my dust to be mingled with yours,neg
"Forever and forever, and forever.",neg
Why should I climb the look out?,neg
At sixteen you departed,neg
"You went into far Ku-to-en, by the river of swirling eddies,",neg
And you have been gone five months.,neg
The monkeys make sorrowful noise overhead.,neg
You dragged your feet when you went out.,neg
"By the gate now, the moss is grown, the different mosses,",neg
Too deep to clear them away!,neg
"The leaves fall early this autumn, in wind.",neg
The paired butterflies are already yellow with August,neg
Over the grass in the West garden;,neg
They hurt me.,neg
I grow older.,neg
"If you are coming down through the narrows of the river Kiang,",neg
"Please let me know beforehand,",neg
And I will come out to meet you,neg
"As far as Cho-fu-Sa.Since there is no escape, since at the end",neg
"My body will be utterly destroyed,",neg
"This hand I love as I have loved a friend,",neg
"This body I tended, wept with and enjoyed;",neg
Since there is no escape even for me,neg
Who love life with a love too sharp to bear:,neg
"The scent of orchards in the rain, the sea",neg
And hours alone too still and sure for prayer,neg
"Since darkness waits for me, then all the more",neg
Let me go down as waves sweep to the shore,neg
"In pride, and let me sing with my last breath;",neg
In these few hours of light I lift my head;,neg
Life is my loverI shall leave the dead,neg
If there is any way to baffle death.,neg
"Too high, too high to pluck",neg
My heart shall swing.,neg
"A fruit no bee shall suck,",neg
No wasp shall sting.,neg
If on some night of cold,neg
It falls to ground,neg
In apple-leaves of gold,neg
Ill wrap it round.,neg
And I shall seal it up,neg
"With spice and salt,",neg
"In a carven silver cup,",neg
In a deep vault.,neg
Before my eyes are blind,neg
"And my lips mute,",neg
I must eat core and rind,neg
Of that same fruit.,neg
Before my heart is dust,neg
"At the end of all,",neg
"Eat it I must, I must",neg
Were it bitter gall.,neg
But I shall keep it sweet,neg
By some strange art;,neg
Wild honey I shall eat,neg
When I eat my heart.,neg
O honey cool and chaste,neg
As clovers breath!,neg
Sweet Heaven I shall taste,neg
Before my death.When the first dark had fallen around them,neg
"And the leaves were weary of praise,",neg
In the clear silence Beauty found them,neg
And shewed them all her ways.,neg
In the high noon of the heavenly garden,neg
"Where the angels sunned with the birds,",neg
"Beauty, before their hearts could harden,",neg
Had taught them heavenly words.,neg
When they fled in the burning weather,neg
"And nothing dawned but a dream,",neg
Beauty fasted their hands together,neg
And cooled them at her stream.,neg
"And when day wearied and night grew stronger,",neg
"And they slept as the beautiful must,",neg
"Then she bided a little longer,",neg
"And blossomed from their dust.My love looks like a girl to-night,",neg
But she is old.,neg
The plaits that lie along her pillow,neg
"Are not gold,",neg
"But threaded with filigree silver,",neg
And uncanny cold.,neg
"She looks like a young maiden, since her brow",neg
"Is smooth and fair,",neg
"Her cheeks are very smooth, her eyes are closed.",neg
She sleeps a rare,neg
"Still winsome sleep, so still, and so composed.",neg
"Nay, but she sleeps like a bride, and dreams her dreams",neg
Of perfect things.,neg
"She lies at last, the darling, in the shape of her dream,",neg
And her dead mouth sings,neg
"By its shape, like the thrushes in clear evenings.The jester walked in the garden:",neg
The garden had fallen still;,neg
He bade his soul rise upward,neg
And stand on her window-sill.,neg
"It rose in a straight blue garment,",neg
When owls began to call:,neg
It had grown wise-tongued by thinking,neg
Of a quiet and light footfall;,neg
But the young queen would not listen;,neg
She rose in her pale night-gown;,neg
She drew in the heavy casement,neg
And pushed the latches down.,neg
"He bade his heart go to her,",neg
When the owls called out no more;,neg
In a red and quivering garment,neg
It sang to her through the door.,neg
It had grown sweet-tongued by dreaming,neg
Of a flutter of flower-like hair;,neg
But she took up her fan from the table,neg
And waved it off on the air.,neg
"'I have cap and bells, he pondered,",neg
'I will send them to her and die;,neg
And when the morning whitened,neg
He left them where she went by.,neg
"She laid them upon her bosom,",neg
"Under a cloud of her hair,",neg
And her red lips sang them a love-song,neg
Till stars grew out of the air.,neg
"She opened her door and her window,",neg
"And the heart and the soul came through,",neg
"To her right hand came the red one,",neg
To her left hand came the blue.,neg
"They set up a noise like crickets,",neg
"A chattering wise and sweet,",neg
And her hair was a folded flower,neg
"And the quiet of love in her feet.What large, dark hands are those at the window",neg
"Lifted, grasping the golden light",neg
Which weaves its way through the creeper leaves,neg
To my heart's delight?,neg
"Ah, only the leaves! But in the west,",neg
In the west I see a redness come,neg
Over the evening's burning breast ,neg
Tis the wound of love goes home!,neg
The woodbine creeps abroad,neg
Calling low to her lover:,neg
The sun-lit flirt who all the day,neg
Has poised above her lips in play,neg
"And stolen kisses, shallow and gay",neg
"Of pollen, now has gone away",neg
"She woos the moth with her sweet, low word,",neg
And when above her his broad wings hover,neg
Then her bright breast she will uncover,neg
And yield her honey-drop to her lover.,neg
"Into the yellow, evening glow",neg
"Saunters a man from the farm below,",neg
"Leans, and looks in at the low-built shed",neg
Where hangs the swallow's marriage bed.,neg
The bird lies warm against the wall.,neg
She glances quick her startled eyes,neg
"Towards him, then she turns away",neg
"Her small head, making warm display",neg
Of red upon the throat. His terrors sway,neg
"Her out of the nest's warm, busy ball,",neg
Whose plaintive cry is heard as she flies,neg
In one blue stoop from out the sties,neg
Into the evening's empty hall.,neg
"Oh, water-hen, beside the rushes",neg
"Hide your quaint, unfading blushes,",neg
"Still your quick tail, and lie as dead,",neg
Till the distance folds over his ominous tread.,neg
"The rabbit presses back her ears,",neg
"Turns back her liquid, anguished eyes",neg
And crouches low: then with wild spring,neg
Spurts from the terror of his oncoming,neg
"To be choked back, the wire ring",neg
Her frantic effort throttling:,neg
Piteous brown ball of quivering fears!,neg
"Ah soon in his large, hard hands she dies,",neg
And swings all loose to the swing of his walk.,neg
Yet calm and kindly are his eyes,neg
And ready to open in brown surprise,neg
Should I not answer to his talk,neg
Or should he my tears surmise.,neg
"I hear his hand on the latch, and rise from my chair",neg
Watching the door open: he flashes bare,neg
"His strong teeth in a smile, and flashes his eyes",neg
In a smile like triumph upon me; then careless-wise,neg
He flings the rabbit soft on the table board,neg
"And comes towards me: ah, the uplifted sword",neg
"Of his hand against my bosom, and oh, the broad",neg
Blade of his hand that raises my face to applaud,neg
His coming: he raises up my face to him,neg
"And caresses my mouth with his fingers, which still smell grim",neg
"Of the rabbit's fur! God, I am caught in a snare!",neg
"I know not what fine wire is round my throat,",neg
I only know I let him finger there,neg
"My pulse of life, letting him nose like a stoat",neg
Who sniffs with joy before he drinks the blood:,neg
"And down his mouth comes to my mouth, and down",neg
His dark bright eyes descend like a fiery hood,neg
"Upon my mind: his mouth meets mine, and a flood",neg
"Of sweet fire sweeps across me, so I drown",neg
"Within him, die, and find death good.Supper comes at five o'clock,",neg
"At six, the evening star,",neg
My lover comes at eight o'clock,neg
But eight o'clock is far.,neg
How could I bear my pain all day,neg
Unless I watched to see,neg
The clock-hands laboring to bring,neg
"Eight o'clock to me.Go, dumb-born book,",neg
Tell her that sang me once that song of Lawes:,neg
Hadst thou but song,neg
"As thou hast subjects known,",neg
Then were there cause in thee that should condone,neg
Even my faults that heavy upon me lie,neg
And build her glories their longevity.,neg
Tell her that sheds,neg
"Such treasure in the air,",neg
Recking naught else but that her graces give,neg
"Life to the moment,",neg
I would bid them live,neg
"As roses might, in magic amber laid,",neg
Red overwrought with orange and all made,neg
One substance and one colour,neg
Braving time.,neg
Tell her that goes,neg
With song upon her lips,neg
"But sings not out the song, nor knows",neg
"The maker of it, some other mouth,",neg
"May be as fair as hers,",neg
"Might, in new ages, gain her worshippers,",neg
"When our two dusts with Wallers shall be laid,",neg
"Siftings on siftings in oblivion,",neg
Till change hath broken down,neg
"All things save Beauty alone.They came to tell your faults to me,",neg
They named them over one by one;,neg
"I laughed aloud when they were done,",neg
"I knew them all so well before, ",neg
"Oh, they were blind, too blind to see",neg
Your faults had made me love you more.I never knew the earth had so much gold,neg
"The fields run over with it, and this hill",neg
"Hoary and old,",neg
Is young with buoyant blooms that flame and thrill.,neg
"Such golden fires, such yellowlo, how good",neg
"This spendthrift world, and what a lavish God!",neg
"This fringe of wood,",neg
Blazing with buttercup and goldenrod.,neg
"You too, beloved, are changed. Again I see",neg
"Your face grow mystical, as on that night",neg
"You turned to me,",neg
And all the trembling worldand youwere white.,neg
"Aye, you are touched; your singing lips grow dumb;",neg
"The fields absorb you, color you entire . . .",neg
And you become,neg
A goddess standing in a world of fire!When she rises in the morning,neg
I linger to watch her;,neg
She spreads the bath-cloth underneath the window,neg
And the sunbeams catch her,neg
"Glistening white on the shoulders,",neg
While down her sides the mellow,neg
Golden shadow glows as,neg
"She stoops to the sponge, and her swung breasts",neg
Sway like full-blown yellow,neg
Gloire de Dijon roses.,neg
"She drips herself with water, and her shoulders",neg
"Glisten as silver, they crumple up",neg
"Like wet and falling roses, and I listen",neg
For the sluicing of their rain-dishevelled petals.,neg
In the window full of sunlight,neg
Concentrates her golden shadow,neg
"Fold on fold, until it glows as",neg
Mellow as the glory roses.,neg
"Yours is the shame and sorrow,",neg
But the disgrace is mine;,neg
"Your love was dark and thorough,",neg
Mine was the love of the sun for a flower,neg
He creates with his shine.,neg
"I was diligent to explore you,",neg
"Blossom you stalk by stalk,",neg
Till my fire of creation bore you,neg
Shrivelling down in the final dour,neg
Anguish  then I suffered a balk.,neg
"I knew your pain, and it broke",neg
"My fine, craftsman's nerve;",neg
"Your body quailed at my stroke,",neg
And my courage failed to give you the last,neg
Fine torture you did deserve.,neg
"You are shapely, you are adorned,",neg
"But opaque and dull in the flesh,",neg
"Who, had I but pierced with the thorned",neg
"Fire-threshing anguish, were fused and cast",neg
In a lovely illumined mesh.,neg
Like a painted window: the best,neg
"Suffering burnt through your flesh,",neg
Undrossed it and left it blest,neg
With a quivering sweet wisdom of grace: but now,neg
Who shall take you afresh?,neg
Now who will burn you free,neg
"From your body's terrors and dross,",neg
Since the fire has failed in me?,neg
What man will stoop in your flesh to plough,neg
The shrieking cross?,neg
"A mute, nearly beautiful thing",neg
"Is your face, that fills me with shame",neg
"As I see it hardening,",neg
"Warping the perfect image of God,",neg
And darkening my eternal fame.,neg
Version 2 (1928),neg
"Yours is the sullen sorrow,",neg
The disgrace is also mine;,neg
"Your love was intense and thorough,",neg
Mine was the love of a growing flower,neg
For the sunshine.,neg
"You had the power to explore me,",neg
Blossom me stalk by stalk;,neg
"You woke my spirit, you bore me",neg
"To consciousness, you gave me the dour",neg
Awareness  then I suffered a balk.,neg
Body to body I could not,neg
"Love you, although I would.",neg
"We kissed, we kissed though we should not.",neg
"You yielded, we threw the last cast,",neg
And it was no good.,neg
"You only endured, and it broke",neg
My craftsman's nerve.,neg
No flesh responded to my stroke;,neg
So I failed to give you the last,neg
Fine torture you did deserve.,neg
"You are shapely, you are adorned",neg
But opaque and null in the flesh;,neg
"Who, had I but pierced with the thorned",neg
"Full anguish, perhaps had been cast",neg
In a lovely illuinined mesh,neg
Like a painted window; the best,neg
"Fire passed through your flesh,",neg
"Undrossed it, and left it blest",neg
In clean new awareness. But now,neg
Who shall take you afresh?,neg
Now who will burn you free,neg
From your body's deadness and dross?,neg
"Since the fire has failed in me,",neg
What man will stoop in your flesh to plough,neg
The shrieking cross?,neg
"A mute, nearly beautiful thing",neg
"Is your face, that fills me with shame",neg
As I see it hardening;,neg
I should have been cruel enough to bring,neg
"You through the flame.Strephon kissed me in the spring,",neg
"Robin in the fall,",neg
But Colin only looked at me,neg
And never kissed at all.,neg
"Strephon's kiss was lost in jest,",neg
"Robin's lost in play,",neg
But the kiss in Colin's eyes,neg
"Haunts me night and day.Let us go then, you and I,",neg
When the evening is spread out against the sky,neg
Like a patient etherized upon a table;,neg
"Let us go, through certain half-deserted streets,",neg
The muttering retreats,neg
Of restless nights in one-night cheap hotels,neg
And sawdust restaurants with oyster-shells:,neg
Streets that follow like a tedious argument,neg
Of insidious intent,neg
To lead you to an overwhelming question ...,neg
"Oh, do not ask, What is it?",neg
Let us go and make our visit.,neg
In the room the women come and go,neg
Talking of Michelangelo.,neg
"The yellow fog that rubs its back upon the window-panes,",neg
"The yellow smoke that rubs its muzzle on the window-panes,",neg
"Licked its tongue into the corners of the evening,",neg
"Lingered upon the pools that stand in drains,",neg
"Let fall upon its back the soot that falls from chimneys,",neg
"Slipped by the terrace, made a sudden leap,",neg
"And seeing that it was a soft October night,",neg
"Curled once about the house, and fell asleep.",neg
And indeed there will be time,neg
"For the yellow smoke that slides along the street,",neg
Rubbing its back upon the window-panes;,neg
"There will be time, there will be time",neg
To prepare a face to meet the faces that you meet;,neg
"There will be time to murder and create,",neg
And time for all the works and days of hands,neg
That lift and drop a question on your plate;,neg
"Time for you and time for me,",neg
"And time yet for a hundred indecisions,",neg
"And for a hundred visions and revisions,",neg
Before the taking of a toast and tea.,neg
In the room the women come and go,neg
Talking of Michelangelo.,neg
And indeed there will be time,neg
"To wonder, Do I dare? and, Do I dare?",neg
"Time to turn back and descend the stair,",neg
With a bald spot in the middle of my hair ,neg
(They will say: How his hair is growing thin!),neg
"My morning coat, my collar mounting firmly to the chin,",neg
"My necktie rich and modest, but asserted by a simple pin ",neg
(They will say: But how his arms and legs are thin!),neg
Do I dare,neg
Disturb the universe?,neg
In a minute there is time,neg
For decisions and revisions which a minute will reverse.,neg
"For I have known them all already, known them all:",neg
"Have known the evenings, mornings, afternoons,",neg
I have measured out my life with coffee spoons;,neg
I know the voices dying with a dying fall,neg
Beneath the music from a farther room.,neg
So how should I presume?,neg
"And I have known the eyes already, known them all",neg
"The eyes that fix you in a formulated phrase,",neg
"And when I am formulated, sprawling on a pin,",neg
"When I am pinned and wriggling on the wall,",neg
Then how should I begin,neg
To spit out all the butt-ends of my days and ways?,neg
And how should I presume?,neg
"And I have known the arms already, known them all",neg
Arms that are braceleted and white and bare,neg
"(But in the lamplight, downed with light brown hair!)",neg
Is it perfume from a dress,neg
That makes me so digress?,neg
"Arms that lie along a table, or wrap about a shawl.",neg
And should I then presume?,neg
And how should I begin?,neg
"Shall I say, I have gone at dusk through narrow streets",neg
And watched the smoke that rises from the pipes,neg
"Of lonely men in shirt-sleeves, leaning out of windows? ...",neg
I should have been a pair of ragged claws,neg
Scuttling across the floors of silent seas.,neg
"And the afternoon, the evening, sleeps so peacefully!",neg
"Smoothed by long fingers,",neg
"Asleep ... tired ... or it malingers,",neg
"Stretched on the floor, here beside you and me.",neg
"Should I, after tea and cakes and ices,",neg
Have the strength to force the moment to its crisis?,neg
"But though I have wept and fasted, wept and prayed,",neg
"Though I have seen my head (grown slightly bald) brought in upon a platter,",neg
I am no prophet  and heres no great matter;,neg
"I have seen the moment of my greatness flicker,",neg
"And I have seen the eternal Footman hold my coat, and snicker,",neg
"And in short, I was afraid.",neg
"And would it have been worth it, after all,",neg
"After the cups, the marmalade, the tea,",neg
"Among the porcelain, among some talk of you and me,",neg
"Would it have been worth while,",neg
"To have bitten off the matter with a smile,",neg
To have squeezed the universe into a ball,neg
"To roll it towards some overwhelming question,",neg
"To say: I am Lazarus, come from the dead,",neg
"Come back to tell you all, I shall tell you all",neg
"If one, settling a pillow by her head",neg
Should say: That is not what I meant at all;,neg
"That is not it, at all.",neg
"And would it have been worth it, after all,",neg
"Would it have been worth while,",neg
"After the sunsets and the dooryards and the sprinkled streets,",neg
"After the novels, after the teacups, after the skirts that trail along the floor",neg
"And this, and so much more?",neg
It is impossible to say just what I mean!,neg
But as if a magic lantern threw the nerves in patterns on a screen:,neg
Would it have been worth while,neg
"If one, settling a pillow or throwing off a shawl,",neg
"And turning toward the window, should say:",neg
"That is not it at all,",neg
"That is not what I meant, at all.",neg
"No! I am not Prince Hamlet, nor was meant to be;",neg
"Am an attendant lord, one that will do",neg
"To swell a progress, start a scene or two,",neg
"Advise the prince; no doubt, an easy tool,",neg
"Deferential, glad to be of use,",neg
"Politic, cautious, and meticulous;",neg
"Full of high sentence, but a bit obtuse;",neg
"At times, indeed, almost ridiculous",neg
"Almost, at times, the Fool.",neg
I grow old ... I grow old ...,neg
I shall wear the bottoms of my trousers rolled.,neg
Shall I part my hair behind?   Do I dare to eat a peach?,neg
"I shall wear white flannel trousers, and walk upon the beach.",neg
"I have heard the mermaids singing, each to each.",neg
I do not think that they will sing to me.,neg
I have seen them riding seaward on the waves,neg
Combing the white hair of the waves blown back,neg
When the wind blows the water white and black.,neg
We have lingered in the chambers of the sea,neg
By sea-girls wreathed with seaweed red and brown,neg
"Till human voices wake us, and we drown.I went to the dances at Chandlerville,",neg
And played snap-out at Winchester.,neg
"One time we changed partners,",neg
"Driving home in the moonlight of middle June,",neg
And then I found Davis.,neg
"We were married and lived together for seventy years,",neg
"Enjoying, working, raising the twelve children,",neg
Eight of whom we lost,neg
Ere I had reached the age of sixty.,neg
"I spun, I wove, I kept the house, I nursed the sick,",neg
"I made the garden, and for holiday",neg
"Rambled over the fields where sang the larks,",neg
"And by Spoon River gathering many a shell,",neg
And many a flower and medicinal weed ,neg
"Shouting to the wooded hills, singing to the green valleys.",neg
"At ninety-six I had lived enough, that is all,",neg
And passed to a sweet repose.,neg
"What is this I hear of sorrow and weariness,",neg
"Anger, discontent and drooping hopes?",neg
"Degenerate sons and daughters,",neg
Life is too strong for you ,neg
"It takes life to love Life.Seen my lady home las' night,",neg
"Jump back, honey, jump back.",neg
"Hel' huh han' an' sque'z it tight,",neg
"Jump back, honey, jump back.",neg
"Hyeahd huh sigh a little sigh,",neg
"Seen a light gleam f'om huh eye,",neg
An' a smile go flittin' by ,neg
"Jump back, honey, jump back.",neg
"Hyeahd de win' blow thoo de pine,",neg
"Jump back, honey, jump back.",neg
"Mockin'-bird was singin' fine,",neg
"Jump back, honey, jump back.",neg
"An' my hea't was beatin' so,",neg
"When I reached my lady's do',",neg
Dat I could n't ba' to go ,neg
"Jump back, honey, jump back.",neg
"Put my ahm aroun' huh wais',",neg
"Jump back, honey, jump back.",neg
"Raised huh lips an' took a tase,",neg
"Jump back, honey, jump back.",neg
"Love me, honey, love me true?",neg
Love me well ez I love you?,neg
"An' she answe'd, ""'Cose I do""",neg
"Jump back, honey, jump back.W'en daih's chillun in de house,",neg

"Fu' yo' 'sperunce goes to show,",neg
"'Twell de gals is ma'ied off,",neg
"It gwine keep on saggin' low.I saw her in a Broadway car,",neg
The woman I might grow to be;,neg
I felt my lover look at her,neg
And then turn suddenly to me.,neg
Her hair was dull and drew no light,neg
And yet its color was as mine;,neg
Her eyes were strangely like my eyes,neg
Tho' love had never made them shine.,neg
"Her body was a thing grown thin,",neg
Hungry for love that never came;,neg
Her soul was frozen in the dark,neg
Unwarmed forever by love's flame.,neg
I felt my lover look at her,neg
"And then turn suddenly to me, ",neg
His eyes were magic to defy,neg
The woman I shall never be.,neg
Just as my fingers on these keys,neg
"Make music, so the selfsame sounds",neg
"On my spirit make a music, too.",neg
"Music is feeling, then, not sound;",neg
"And thus it is that what I feel,",neg
"Here in this room, desiring you,",neg
"Thinking of your blue-shadowed silk,",neg
Is music. It is like the strain,neg
Waked in the elders by Susanna: ,neg
"Of a green evening, clear and warm,",neg
"She bathed in her still garden, while",neg
"The red-eyed elders, watching, felt",neg
The basses of their beings throb,neg
"In witching chords, and their thin blood",neg
Pulse pizzicati of Hosanna.,neg
"In the green water, clear and warm,",neg
Susanna lay.,neg
She searched,neg
"The touch of springs,",neg
And found,neg
Concealed imaginings.,neg
"She sighed,",neg
For so much melody.,neg
"Upon the bank, she stood",neg
In the cool,neg
Of spent emotions.,neg
"She felt, among the leaves,",neg
The dew,neg
Of old devotions.,neg
"She walked upon the grass,",neg
Still quavering.,neg
"The winds were like her maids,",neg
"On timid feet,",neg
"Fetching her woven scarves,",neg
Yet wavering.,neg
A breath upon her hand,neg
Muted the night.,neg
She turned,neg
"A cymbal crashed,",neg
And roaring horns.,neg
"Soon, with a noise like tambourines,",neg
Came her attendant Byzantines.,neg
They wondered why Susanna cried,neg
Against the elders by her side;,neg
"And as they whispered, the refrain",neg
Was like a willow swept by rain.,neg
"Anon, their lamps' uplifted flame",neg
Revealed Susanna and her shame.,neg
"And then, the simpering Byzantines",neg
"Fled, with a noise like tambourines.",neg
Beauty is momentary in the mind,neg
The fitful tracing of a portal;,neg
But in the flesh it is immortal.,neg
The body dies; the body's beauty lives.,neg
"So evenings die, in their green going,",neg
"A wave, interminably flowing.",neg
"So gardens die, their meek breath scenting",neg
"The cowl of winter, done repenting.",neg
"So maidens die, to the auroral",neg
Celebration of a maiden's choral.,neg
Susanna's music touched the bawdy strings,neg
"Of those white elders; but, escaping,",neg
Left only Death's ironic scraping.,neg
"Now, in its immortality, it plays",neg
"On the clear viol of her memory,",neg
And makes a constant sacrament of praise.I,neg
Among the smoke and fog of a December afternoon,neg
You have the scene arrange itself  as it will seem to do,neg
"With ""I have saved this afternoon for you"";",neg
"And four wax candles in the darkened room,",neg
"Four rings of light upon the ceiling overhead,",neg
An atmosphere of Juliet's tomb,neg
"Prepared for all the things to be said, or left unsaid.",neg
"We have been, let us say, to hear the latest Pole",neg
"Transmit the Preludes, through his hair and finger-tips.",neg
"So intimate, this Chopin, that I think his soul
Should be resurrected only among friends
Some two or three, who will not touch the bloom
That is rubbed and questioned in the concert room.",neg
And so the conversation slips,neg
Among velleities and carefully caught regrets,neg
Through attenuated tones of violins,neg
Mingled with remote cornets,neg
And begins.,neg
"You do not know how much they mean to me, my friends,",neg
"And how, how rare and strange it is, to find",neg
"In a life composed so much, so much of odds and ends,",neg
(For indeed I do not love it ... you knew? you are not blind!,neg
How keen you are!),neg
"To find a friend who has these qualities,",neg
"Who has, and gives",neg
Those qualities upon which friendship lives.,neg
How much it means that I say this to you ,neg
"Without these friendships  life, what cauchemar!",neg
Among the winding of the violins,neg
And the ariettes,neg
Of cracked cornets,neg
Inside my brain a dull tom-tom begins,neg
"Absurdly hammering a prelude of its own,",neg
Capricious monotone,neg
"That is at least one definite ""false note.""",neg
" Let us take the air, in a tobacco trance,",neg
"Admire the monuments,",neg
"Discuss the late events,",neg
Correct our watches by the public clocks.,neg
Then sit for half an hour and drink our bocks.,neg
Now that lilacs are in bloom,neg
She has a bowl of lilacs in her room,neg
And twists one in her fingers while she talks.,neg
"Ah, my friend, you do not know, you do not know
What life is, you who hold it in your hands;",neg
(Slowly twisting the lilac stalks),neg
"You let it flow from you, you let it flow,
And youth is cruel, and has no remorse
And smiles at situations which it cannot see.",neg
"I smile, of course,",neg
And go on drinking tea.,neg
"Yet with these April sunsets, that somehow recall",neg
"My buried life, and Paris in the Spring,",neg
"I feel immeasurably at peace, and find the world",neg
"To be wonderful and youthful, after all.",neg
The voice returns like the insistent out-of-tune,neg
Of a broken violin on an August afternoon:,neg
I am always sure that you understand,neg
"My feelings, always sure that you feel,",neg
Sure that across the gulf you reach your hand.,neg
"You are invulnerable, you have no Achilles' heel.",neg
"You will go on, and when you have prevailed",neg
You can say: at this point many a one has failed.,neg
"But what have I, but what have I, my friend,",neg
"To give you, what can you receive from me?",neg
Only the friendship and the sympathy,neg
Of one about to reach her journey's end.,neg
"I shall sit here, serving tea to friends ....",neg
I take my hat: how can I make a cowardly amends,neg
For what she has said to me?,neg
You will see me any morning in the park,neg
Reading the comics and the sporting page.,neg
Particularly I remark.,neg
An English countess goes upon the stage.,neg
"A Greek was murdered at a Polish dance,",neg
Another bank defaulter has confessed.,neg
"I keep my countenance,",neg
I remain self-possessed,neg
"Except when a street-piano, mechanical and tired",neg
Reiterates some worn-out common song,neg
With the smell of hyacinths across the garden,neg
Recalling things that other people have desired.,neg
Are these ideas right or wrong?,neg
The October night comes down; returning as before,neg
Except for a slight sensation of being ill at ease,neg
I mount the stairs and turn the handle of the door,neg
And feel as if I had mounted on my hands and knees.,neg
And so you are going abroad; and when do you return?,neg
But that's a useless question.,neg
"You hardly know when you are coming back,",neg
You will find so much to learn.,neg
My smile falls heavily among the bric-a-brac.,neg
Perhaps you can write to me.,neg
My self-possession flares up for a second;,neg
This is as I had reckoned.,neg
"I have been wondering frequently of late
(But our beginnings never know our ends!)
Why we have not developed into friends.",neg
"I feel like one who smiles, and turning shall remark",neg
"Suddenly, his expression in a glass.",neg
My self-possession gutters; we are really in the dark.,neg
"For everybody said so, all our friends,",neg
They all were sure our feelings would relate,neg
So closely! I myself can hardly understand.,neg
We must leave it now to fate.,neg
"You will write, at any rate.",neg
Perhaps it is not too late.,neg
"I shall sit here, serving tea to friends.",neg
And I must borrow every changing shape,neg
"To find expression ... dance, dance",neg
"Like a dancing bear,",neg
"Cry like a parrot, chatter like an ape.",neg
"Let us take the air, in a tobacco trance",neg
"Well! and what if she should die some afternoon,",neg
"Afternoon grey and smoky, evening yellow and rose;",neg
Should die and leave me sitting pen in hand,neg
With the smoke coming down above the housetops;,neg
"Doubtful, for quite a while",neg
Not knowing what to feel or if I understand,neg
"Or whether wise or foolish, tardy or too soon ...",neg
"Would she not have the advantage, after all?",neg
"This music is successful with a ""dying fall""",neg
Now that we talk of dying,neg
"And should I have the right to smile?Maurice, weep not, I am not here under this pine tree.",neg
"The balmy air of spring whispers through the sweet grass,",neg
"The stars sparkle, the whippoorwill calls,",neg
"But thou grievest, while my soul lies rapturous",neg
In the blest Nirvana of eternal light!,neg
"Go to the good heart that is my husband,",neg
Who broods upon what he calls our guilty love: i,neg
"Tell him that my love for you, no less than my love for him",neg
Wrought out my destiny i that through the flesh,neg
"I won spirit, and through spirit, peace.",neg
"There is no marriage in heaven,",neg
But there is love.I shall not go with pain,neg
"Whether you hold me, whether you forget",neg
My little loss and my immortal gain.,neg
"O flower unseen, O fountain sealed apart!",neg
"Give me one look, one look remembering yet,",neg
Sweet heart.,neg
"I shall not go with grief,",neg
"Whether you call me, whether you deny",neg
The crowning vintage and the golden sheaf.,neg
"O, April hopes that blossom but to close!",neg
"Give me one look, one look and so good-bye,",neg
Red rose.,neg
"I shall not go with sighs,",neg
"But as full-crowned the warrior leaves the fight,",neg
Dawn on his shield and death upon his eyes.,neg
"O, life so bitter-sweet and heaven so far!",neg
"Give me one look, one look and so good night,",neg
"My star.Wintah, summah, snow er shine,",neg
"Hit's all de same to me,",neg
"Ef only I kin call you mine,",neg
An' keep you by my knee.,neg
"Ha'dship, frolic, grief er caih,",neg
"Content by night an' day,",neg
Ef only I kin see you whaih,neg
You wait beside de way.,neg
"Livin', dyin', smiles er teahs,",neg
"My soul will still be free,",neg
Ef only thoo de comin' yeahs,neg
You walk de worl' wid me.,neg
"Bird-song, breeze-wail, chune er moan,",neg
"What puny t'ings dey'll be,",neg
"Ef w'en I's seemin' all erlone,",neg
I knows yo' hea't's wid me.This youth too long has heard the break,neg
Of waters in a land of change.,neg
He goes to see what suns can make,neg
From soil more indurate and strange.,neg
He cuts what holds his days together,neg
"And shuts him in, as lock on lock:",neg
"The arrowed vane announcing weather,",neg
The tripping racket of a clock;,neg
"Seeking, I think, a light that waits",neg
"Still as a lamp upon a shelf, ",neg
A land with hills like rocky gates,neg
Where no sea leaps upon itself.,neg
But he will find that nothing dares,neg
"To be enduring, save where, south",neg
"Of hidden deserts, torn fire glares",neg
"On beauty with a rusted mouth, ",neg
Where something dreadful and another,neg
Look quietly upon each other.Making his advances,neg
"He does not look at her, nor sniff at her,",neg
"No, not even sniff at her, his nose is blank.",neg
Only he senses the vulnerable folds of skin,neg
That work beneath her while she sprawls along,neg
"In her ungainly pace,",neg
Her folds of skin that work and row,neg
Beneath the earth-soiled hovel in which she moves.,neg
And so he strains beneath her housey walls,neg
And catches her trouser-legs in his beak,neg
"Suddenly, or her skinny limb,",neg
And strange and grimly drags at her,neg
"Like a dog,",neg
"Only agelessly silent, with a reptile's awful persistency.",neg
"Grim, gruesome gallantry, to which he is doomed.",neg
Dragged out of an eternity of silent isolation,neg
"And doomed to partiality, partial being,",neg
"Ache, and want of being,",neg
"Want,",neg
"Self-exposure, hard humiliation, need to add himself on to her.",neg
"Born to walk alone,",neg
"Forerunner,",neg
"Now suddenly distracted into this mazy side-track,",neg
"This awkward, harrowing pursuit,",neg
This grim necessity from within.,neg
Does she know,neg
As she moves eternally slowly away?,neg
"Or is he driven against her with a bang, like a bird flying in the dark against a window,",neg
All knowledgeless?,neg
"The awful concussion,",neg
"And the still more awful need to persist, to follow, follow, continue,",neg
"Driven, after ons of pristine, fore-god-like singleness and oneness,",neg
"At the end of some mysterious, red-hot iron,",neg
"Driven away from himself into her tracks,",neg
Forced to crash against her.,neg
"Stiff, gallant, irascible, crook-legged reptile,",neg
"Little gentleman,",neg
"Sorry plight,",neg
We ought to look the other way.,neg
"Save that, having come with you so far,",neg
"We will go on to the end.I thought he was dumb,",neg
"I said he was dumb,",neg
Yet I've heard him cry.,neg
"First faint scream,",neg
"Out of life's unfathomable dawn,",neg
"Far off, so far, like a madness, under the horizon's dawning rim,",neg
"Far, far off, far scream.",neg
Tortoise in extremis.,neg
Why were we crucified into sex?,neg
"Why were we not left rounded off, and finished in ourselves,",neg
"As we began,",neg
"As he certainly began, so perfectly alone?",neg
"A far, was-it-audible scream,",neg
Or did it sound on the plasm direct?,neg
"Worse than the cry of the new-born,",neg
"A scream,",neg
"A yell,",neg
"A shout,",neg
"A pan,",neg
"A death-agony,",neg
"A birth-cry,",neg
"A submission,",neg
"All tiny, tiny, far away, reptile under the first dawn.",neg
"War-cry, triumph, acute-delight, death-scream reptilian,",neg
Why was the veil torn?,neg
The silken shriek of the soul's torn membrane?,neg
The male soul's membrane,neg
"Torn with a shriek half music, half horror.",neg
Crucifixion.,neg
"Male tortoise, cleaving behind the hovel-wall of that dense female,",neg
"Mounted and tense, spread-eagle, out-reaching out of the shell",neg
"In tortoise-nakedness,",neg
"Long neck, and long vulnerable limbs extruded, spread-eagle over her house-roof,",neg
"And the deep, secret, all-penetrating tail curved beneath her walls,",neg
"Reaching and gripping tense, more reaching anguish in uttermost tension",neg
"Till suddenly, in the spasm of coition, tupping like a jerking leap, and oh!",neg
Opening its clenched face from his outstretched neck,neg
"And giving that fragile yell, that scream,",neg
"Super-audible,",neg
"From his pink, cleft, old-man's mouth,",neg
"Giving up the ghost,",neg
"Or screaming in Pentecost, receiving the ghost.",neg
"His scream, and his moment's subsidence,",neg
"The moment of eternal silence,",neg
"Yet unreleased, and after the moment, the sudden, startling jerk of coition, and at once",neg
The inexpressible faint yell ,neg
"And so on, till the last plasm of my body was melted back",neg
"To the primeval rudiments of life, and the secret.",neg
"So he tups, and screams",neg
"Time after time that frail, torn scream",neg
"After each jerk, the longish interval,",neg
"The tortoise eternity,",neg
"Agelong, reptilian persistence,",neg
"Heart-throb, slow heart-throb, persistent for the next spasm.",neg
"I remember, when I was a boy,",neg
"I heard the scream of a frog, which was caught with his foot in the mouth of an up-starting snake;",neg
I remember when I first heard bull-frogs break into sound in the spring;,neg
I remember hearing a wild goose out of the throat of night,neg
"Cry loudly, beyond the lake of waters;",neg
"I remember the first time, out of a bush in the darkness, a nightingale's piercing cries and gurgles startled the depths of my soul;",neg
I remember the scream of a rabbit as I went through a wood at midnight;,neg
"I remember the heifer in her heat, blorting and blorting through the hours, persistent and irrepressible;",neg
"I remember my first terror hearing the howl of weird, amorous cats;",neg
"I remember the scream of a terrified, injured horse, the sheet-lightning",neg
"And running away from the sound of a woman in labor, something like an owl whooing,",neg
"And listening inwardly to the first bleat of a lamb,",neg
"The first wail of an infant,",neg
"And my mother singing to herself,",neg
"And the first tenor singing of the passionate throat of a young collier, who has long since drunk himself to death,",neg
The first elements of foreign speech,neg
On wild dark lips.,neg
"And more than all these,",neg
"And less than all these,",neg
"This last,",neg
"Strange, faint coition yell",neg
"Of the male tortoise at extremity,",neg
Tiny from under the very edge of the farthest far-off horizon of life.,neg
"The cross,",neg
"The wheel on which our silence first is broken,",neg
"Sex, which breaks up our integrity, our single inviolability, our deep silence",neg
Tearing a cry from us.,neg
"Sex, which breaks us into voice, sets us calling across the deeps, calling, calling for the complement,",neg
"Singing, and calling, and singing again, being answered, having found.",neg
"Torn, to become whole again, after long seeking for what is lost,",neg
"The same cry from the tortoise as from Christ, the Osiris-cry of abandonment,",neg
"That which is whole, torn asunder,",neg
"That which is in part, finding its whole again throughout the universe. With the man I love who loves me not,",neg
I walked in the street-lamps' flare;,neg
We watched the world go home that night,neg
In a flood through Union Square.,neg
I leaned to catch the words he said,neg
That were light as a snowflake falling;,neg
Ah well that he never leaned to hear,neg
The words my heart was calling.,neg
And on we walked and on we walked,neg
Past the fiery lights of the picture shows ,neg
Where the girls with thirsty eyes go by,neg
On the errand each man knows.,neg
"And on we walked and on we walked,",neg
At the door at last we said good-bye;,neg
I knew by his smile he had not heard,neg
My heart's unuttered cry.,neg
With the man I love who loves me not,neg
I walked in the street-lamps' flare ,neg
"But oh, the girls who ask for love",neg
In the lights of Union Square.,neg
"When you are old and grey and full of sleep,",neg
"And nodding by the fire, take down this book,",neg
"And slowly read, and dream of the soft look",neg
"Your eyes had once, and of their shadows deep;",neg
"How many loved your moments of glad grace,",neg
"And loved your beauty with love false or true,",neg
"But one man loved the pilgrim soul in you,",neg
And loved the sorrows of your changing face;,neg
"And bending down beside the glowing bars,",neg
"Murmur, a little sadly, how Love fled",neg
And paced upon the mountains overhead,neg
"And hid his face amid a crowd of stars.Give me hunger,",neg
O you gods that sit and give,neg
The world its orders.,neg
"Give me hunger, pain and want,",neg
Shut me out with shame and failure,neg
"From your doors of gold and fame,",neg
"Give me your shabbiest, weariest hunger!",neg
"But leave me a little love,",neg
"A voice to speak to me in the day end,",neg
A hand to touch me in the dark room,neg
Breaking the long loneliness.,neg
In the dusk of day-shapes,neg
"Blurring the sunset,",neg
"One little wandering, western star",neg
Thrust out from the changing shores of shadow.,neg
"Let me go to the window,",neg
Watch there the day-shapes of dusk,neg
And wait and know the coming,neg
"Of a little love.Potuia, potuia",neg
"White grave goddess,",neg
"Pity my sadness,",neg
O silence of Paros.,neg
"I am not of these about thy feet,",neg
These garments and decorum;,neg
"I am thy brother,",neg
"Thy lover of aforetime crying to thee,",neg
And thou hearest me not.,neg
I have whispered thee in thy solitudes,neg
"Of our loves in Phrygia,",neg
The far ecstasy of burning noons,neg
When the fragile pipes,neg
"Ceased in the cypress shade,",neg
And the brown fingers of the shepherd,neg
Moved over slim shoulders;,neg
And only the cicada sang.,neg
I have told thee of the hills,neg
And the lisp of reeds,neg
"And the sun upon thy breasts,",neg
"And thou hearest me not,",neg
"Potuia, potuia",neg
Thou hearest me not.,neg
"I leaned against the mantel, sick, sick,",neg
"Thinking of my failure, looking into the abysm,",neg
Weak from the noon-day heat.,neg
"A church bell sounded mournfully far away,",neg
"I heard the cry of a baby,",neg
"And the coughing of John Yarnell,",neg
"Bed-ridden, feverish, feverish, dying,",neg
Then the violent voice of my wife:,neg
"Watch out, the potatoes are burning!",neg
I smelled them ... then there was irresistible disgust.,neg
I pulled the trigger ... blackness ... light ...,neg
Unspeakable regret ... fumbling for the world again.,neg
"Too late! Thus I came here,",neg
"With lungs for breathing ... one cannot breathe here with lungs,",neg
Though one must breathe,neg
"Of what use is it To rid one's self of the world,",neg
When no soul may ever escape the eternal destiny of life?I was the first fruits of the battle of Missionary Ridge.,neg
When I felt the bullet enter my heart,neg
I wished I had staid at home and gone to jail,neg
"For stealing the hogs of Curl Trenary,",neg
Instead of running away and joining the army.,neg
Rather a thousand times the county jail,neg
"Than to lie under this marble figure with wings,",neg
"And this granite pedestal Bearing the words, Pro Patria.",neg
"What do they mean, anyway?I was only eight years old;",neg
And before I grew up and knew what it meant,neg
"I had no words for it, except",neg
That I was frightened and told my,neg
Mother; And that my Father got a pistol,neg
"And would have killed Charlie, who was a big boy,",neg
"Fifteen years old, except for his Mother.",neg
Nevertheless the story clung to me.,neg
"But the man who married me, a widower of thirty-five,",neg
Was a newcomer and never heard it,neg
Till two years after we were married.,neg
"Then he considered himself cheated,",neg
And the village agreed that I was not really a virgin.,neg
"Well, he deserted me, and I died",neg
The following winter.,neg
Why should I blame her that she filled my days,neg
"With misery, or that she would of late",neg
"Have taught to ignorant men most violent ways,",neg
"Or hurled the little streets upon the great,",neg
Had they but courage equal to desire?,neg
What could have made her peaceful with a mind,neg
"That nobleness made simple as a fire,",neg
"With beauty like a tightened bow, a kind",neg
"That is not natural in an age like this,",neg
Being high and solitary and most stern?,neg
"Why, what could she have done, being what she is?",neg
Was there another Troy for her to burn?I ,neg
GLOOM! ,neg
An October like November; ,neg
"August a hundred thousand hours, ",neg
"And all September, ",neg
"A hundred thousand, dragging sunlit days, ",neg
And half October like a thousand years . . . ,neg
And doom! ,neg
That then was Antwerp. . . ,neg
"In the name of God, ",neg
How could they do it? ,neg
Those souls that usually dived ,neg
Into the dirty caverns of mines; ,neg
Who usually hived ,neg
In whitened hovels; under ragged poplars; ,neg
"Who dragged muddy shovels, over the grassy mud, ",neg
Lumbering to work over the greasy sods. . . ,neg
"Those men there, with the appearance of clods ",neg
Were the bravest men that a usually listless priest of God ,neg
Ever shrived. . . ,neg
And it is not for us to make them an anthem. ,neg
If we found words there would come no wind that would fan them ,neg
"To a tune that the trumpets might blow it, ",neg
"Shrill through the heaven that's ours or yet Allah's, ",neg
Or the wide halls of any Valhallas. ,neg
We can make no such anthem. So that all that is ours ,neg
"For inditing in sonnets, pantoums, elegiacs, or lays ",neg
"In the name of God, how could they do it? ",neg
"For there is no new thing under the sun, ",neg
Only this uncomely man with a smoking gun ,neg
In the gloom. . . ,neg
What the devil will he gain by it? ,neg
Digging a hole in the mud and standing all day in the rain by it ,neg
Waiting his doom; ,neg
"The sharp blow, the swift outpouring of the blood, ",neg
Till the trench of gray mud ,neg
Is turned to a brown purple drain by it. ,neg
"Well, there have been scars ",neg
Won in many wars . . .,neg
"Punic, ",neg
"Lacedmonian, wars of Napoleon, wars for faith, wars for honour, for love, for possession, ",neg
"But this Belgian man in his ugly tunic, ",neg
"His ugly round cap, shooting on, in a sort of obsession, ",neg
"Overspreading his miserable land, ",neg
Standing with his wet gun in his hand . . . ,neg
Doom! ,neg
"He finds that in a sudden scrimmage, ",neg
"And lies, an unsightly lump on the sodden grass . . . ",neg
An image that shall take long to pass! ,neg
For the white-limbed heroes of Hellas ride by upon their horses ,neg
Forever through our brains. ,neg
The heroes of Cressy ride by upon their stallions; ,neg
And battalions and battalions and battalions ,neg
"The Old Guard, the Young Guard, the men of Minden and of Waterloo, ",neg
"Pass, for ever staunch, ",neg
"Stand, for ever true; ",neg
"And the small man with the large paunch, ",neg
"And the gray coat, and the large hat, and the hands behind the back, ",neg
Watches them pass ,neg
In our minds for ever . . . ,neg
But that clutter of sodden corses ,neg
On the sodden Belgian grass ,neg
That is a strange new beauty. ,neg
"With no especial legends of marchings or triumphs or duty, ",neg
"Assuredly that is the way of it, ",neg
The way of beauty . . . ,neg
And that is the highest word you can find to say of it. ,neg
For you cannot praise it with words ,neg
"Compounded of lyres and swords, ",neg
But the thought of the gloom and the rain ,neg
"And the ugly coated figure, standing beside a drain, ",neg
Shall eat itself into your brain: ,neg
"And you will say of all heroes, They fought like the Belgians! ",neg
And you will say: He wrought like a Belgian his fate out of gloom. ,neg
And you will say: He bought like a Belgian his doom. ,neg
And that shall be an honourable name; ,neg
Belgian shall be an honourable word; ,neg
"As honourable as the fame of the sword, ",neg
"As honourable as the mention of the many-chorded lyre, ",neg
And his old coat shall seem as beautiful as the fabrics woven in Tyre. ,neg
And what in the world did they bear it for? ,neg
I don't know. ,neg
And what in the world did they dare it for? ,neg
Perhaps that is not for the likes of me to understand. ,neg
They could very well have watched a hundred legions go ,neg
Over their fields and between their cities ,neg
Down into more southerly regions. ,neg
"They could very well have let the legions pass through their woods, ",neg
And have kept their lives and their wives and their children and cattle and goods. ,neg
I don't understand. ,neg
Was it just love of their land? ,neg
"Oh, poor dears! ",neg
Can any man so love his land? ,neg
Give them a thousand thousand pities ,neg
And rivers and rivers of tears ,neg
To wash off the blood from the cities of Flanders. ,neg
This is Charing Cross; ,neg
It is midnight; ,neg
There is a great crowd ,neg
And no light. ,neg
"A great crowd, all black that hardly whispers aloud. ",neg
"Surely, that is a dead womana dead mother! ",neg
She has a dead face; ,neg
She is dressed all in black; ,neg
"She wanders to the bookstall and back, ",neg
At the back of the crowd; ,neg
"And back again and again back, ",neg
She sways and wanders. ,neg
This is Charing Cross; ,neg
It is one o'clock. ,neg
"There is still a great cloud, and very little light; ",neg
Immense shafts of shadows over the black crowd ,neg
That hardly whispers aloud. . . ,neg
"And now! .  . That is another dead mother, ",neg
And there is another and another and another. . . ,neg
"And little children, all in black, ",neg
"All with dead faces, waiting in all the waiting-places, ",neg
Wandering from the doors of the waiting-room ,neg
In the dim gloom. ,neg
These are the women of Flanders.,neg
They await the lost. ,neg
They await the lost that shall never leave the dock; ,neg
They await the lost that shall never again come by the train ,neg
To the embraces of all these women with dead faces; ,neg
"They await the lost who lie dead in trench and barrier and foss, ",neg
In the dark of the night. ,neg
This is Charing Cross; it is past one of the clock; ,neg
There is very little light. ,neg
There is so much pain. ,neg
And it was for this that they endured this gloom; ,neg
"This October like November, ",neg
"That August like a hundred thousand hours, ",neg
"And that September, ",neg
"A hundred thousand dragging sunlit days, ",neg
And half October like a thousand years. . . ,neg
"Oh, poor dears!As I went up by Ovillers",neg
"In mud and water cold to the knee,",neg
"There went three jeering, fleering spectres,",neg
That walked abreast and talked of me.,neg
"The first said, Heres a right brave soldier",neg
That walks the dark unfearingly;,neg
"Soon hell come back on a fine stretcher,",neg
And laughing for a nice Blighty.,neg
"The second, Read his face, old comrade,",neg
No kind of lucky chance I see;,neg
"One day hell freeze in mud to the marrow,",neg
Then look his last on Picardie.,neg
Though bitter the word of these first twain,neg
Curses the third spat venomously;,neg
Hell stay untouched till the wars last dawning,neg
Then live one hour of agony.,neg
Liars the first two were. Behold me,neg
At sloping arms by one  two  three;,neg
Waiting the time I shall discover,neg
Whether the third spake verity.She was a village,neg
Of lovely knowledge,neg
"The high roads left her aside, she was forlorn, a maid ",neg
"Water ran there, dusk hid her, she climbed four-wayed.",neg
Brown-gold windows showed last folk not yet asleep;,neg
"Water ran, was a centre of silence deep,",neg
"Fathomless deeps of pricked sky, almost fathomless",neg
Hallowed an upward gaze in pale satin of blue.,neg
"And I was happy indeed, of mind, soul, body even",neg
Having got given,neg
A sign undoubtful of a dear England few,neg
"Doubt, not many have seen,",neg
That Will Squele he knew and was so shriven.,neg
"Home of Twelfth Night  Edward Thomas by Arras fallen,",neg
"Borrow and Hardy, Sussex tales out of Roman heights callen.",neg
No madrigals or field-songs to my all reverent whim;,neg
"Till I got back I was dumb.If it were not for England, who would bear",neg
This heavy servitude one moment more?,neg
"To keep a brothel, sweep and wash the floor",neg
Of filthiest hovels were noble to compare,neg
"With this brass-cleaning life. Now here, now there",neg
"Harried in foolishness, scanned curiously o'er",neg
"By fools made brazen by conceit, and store",neg
Of antique witticisms thin and bare.,neg
"Only the love of comrades sweetens all,",neg
Whose laughing spirit will not be outdone.,neg
As night-watching men wait for the sun,neg
"To hearten them, so wait I on such boys",neg
"As neither brass nor Hell-fire may appal,",neg
"Nor guns, nor sergeant-major's bluster and noise.Only the wanderer",neg
"Knows England's graces,",neg
Or can anew see clear,neg
Familiar faces.,neg
And who loves joy as he,neg
That dwells in shadows?,neg
"Do not forget me quite,",neg
"O Severn meadows.Little did I dream, England, that you bore me",neg
"Under the Cotswold hills beside the water meadows,",neg
"To do you dreadful service, here, beyond your borders",neg
And your enfolding seas.,neg
"I was a dreamer ever, and bound to your dear service,",neg
"Meditating deep, I thought on your secret beauty,",neg
As through a child's face one may see the clear spirit,neg
Miraculously shining.,neg
"Your hills not only hills, but friends of mine and kindly,",neg
Your tiny knolls and orchards hidden beside the river,neg
"Muddy and strongly flowing, with shy and tiny streamlets",neg
Safe in its bosom.,neg
"Now these are memories only, and your skies and rushy sky-pools",neg
Fragile mirrors easily broken by moving airs ...,neg
"But deep in my heart for ever goes on your daily being,",neg
And uses consecrate.,neg
"Think on me too, O Mother, who wrest my soul to serve you",neg
In strange and fearful ways beyond your encircling waters;,neg
"None but you can know my heart, its tears and sacrifice;",neg
"None, but you, repay.He's gone, and all our plans",neg
Are useless indeed.,neg
We'll walk no more on Cotswold,neg
Where the sheep feed,neg
Quietly and take no heed.,neg
His body that was so quick,neg
Is not as you,neg
"Knew it, on Severn river",neg
Under the blue,neg
Driving our small boat through.,neg
You would not know him now ...,neg
But still he died,neg
"Nobly, so cover him over",neg
With violets of pride,neg
Purple from Severn side.,neg
"Cover him, cover him soon!",neg
And with thick-set,neg
Masses of memoried flowers,neg
Hide that red wet,neg
"Thing I must somehow forget.Now, youth, the hour of thy dread passion comes;",neg
Thy lovely things must all be laid away;,neg
"And thou, as others, must face the riven day",neg
"Unstirred by rattle of the rolling drums,",neg
Or bugles' strident cry. When mere noise numbs,neg
"The sense of being, the sick soul doth sway,",neg
"Remember thy great craft's honour, that they may say",neg
Nothing in shame of poets. Then the crumbs,neg
Of praise the little versemen joyed to take,neg
"Shall be forgotten; then they must know we are,",neg
"For all our skill in words, equal in might",neg
And strong of mettle as those we honoured; make,neg
"The name of poet terrible in just war,",neg
And like a crown of honour upon the fight.When I remember plain heroic strength,neg
"And shining virtue shown by Ypres pools,",neg
Then read the blither written by knaves for fools,neg
"In praise of English soldiers lying at length,",neg
Who purely dream what England shall be made,neg
"Gloriously new, free of the old stains",neg
"By us, who pay the price that must be paid,",neg
Will freeze all winter over Ypres plains.,neg
Our silly dreams of peace you put aside,neg
"And brotherhood of man, for you will see",neg
"An armed mistress, braggart of the tide,",neg
"Her children slaves, under your mastery.",neg
"We'll have a word there too, and forge a knife,",neg
Will cut the cancer threatens England's life.,neg
"So in Pieria, from the wedded bliss",neg
"Of Time and Memory, the Muses came",neg
"To be the means of rich oblivion,",neg
And rest from cares.  And when the Thunderer,neg
"Took heaven, then the Titans warred on him",neg
"For pity of mankind. But the great law,",neg
"Which is the law of music, not of bread,",neg
"Set Atlas for a pillar, manacled",neg
"His brother to the rocks of the Scythia,",neg
And under Aetna fixed the furious Typhon.,neg
"So should thought rule, not force. And Amphion,",neg
"Pursuing justice, entered Thebes and slew",neg
His mother's spouse; but when he would make sure,neg
"And fortify the city, then he took",neg
"The lyre that Hermes gave, and played, and watched",neg
"The stones move and assemble, till a wall",neg
Engirded Thebes and kept the citadel,neg
Beyond the reach of arrows and of fire.,neg
What other power but harmony can build,neg
"A city, and what gift so magical",neg
As that by which a city lifts its walls?,neg
"So men, in years to come, shall feel the power",neg
Of this man moving through the high-ranged thought,neg
"Which plans for beauty, builds for larger life.",neg
The stones shall rise in towers to answer him.My bands of silk and miniver,neg
Momently grew heavier;,neg
The black gauze was beggarly thin;,neg
The ermine muffled mouth and chin;,neg
I could not suck the moonlight in.,neg
Harlequin in lozenges,neg
"Of love and hate, I walked in these",neg
Striped and ragged rigmaroles;,neg
Along the pavement my footsoles,neg
Trod warily on living coals.,neg
"Shouldering the thoughts I loathed,",neg
"In their corrupt disguises clothed,",neg
Morality I could not tear,neg
"From my ribs, to leave them bare",neg
Ivory in silver air.,neg
"There I walked, and there I raged;",neg
The spiritual savage caged,neg
"Within my skeleton, raged afresh",neg
"To feel, behind a carnal mesh,",neg
The clean bones crying in the flesh.,neg
"Behoild Pelides with his yellow hair,",neg
"Proud child of Thetis, hero loved of Jove;",neg
Above the frowning of his brows of wove,neg
"A crown of gold, well combed, with Spartan care.",neg
"Who might have seen him, sullen, great, and fair,",neg
"As with the wrongful world he proudly strove,",neg
"And by high deeds his wilder passion shrove,",neg
"Mastering love, resentment, and despair.",neg
"He knew his end, and Phoebus arrow sure",neg
"He braved for fame immortal and a friend,",neg
"Despising life; and we, who know our end,",neg
Know that in our decay he shall endure,neg
"And all our childrens hearts to grief inure,",neg
With whose first bitter battles his shall blend.,neg
"Who brought thee forth, immortal vision, who",neg
In Phthia or in Tempe brought thee forth?,neg
Out of the sunlight and the sapful earth,neg
What god the simples of thy spirit drew?,neg
"A goddess rose from the green waves, and threw",neg
"Her arms about a king, to give thee birth;",neg
"A centaur, patron of thy boyish mirth,",neg
Over the meadows in thy footsteps flew.,neg
"Now Thessaly forgets thee, and the deep",neg
Thy keeled bark furrowed answers not thy prayer;,neg
But far away new generations keep,neg
Thy laurels fresh; where branching Isis hems,neg
"The lawns of Oxford round about, or where",neg
Enchanted Eton sits by pleasant Thames.,neg
I gaze on thee as Phidias of old,neg
"Or Polyclitus gazed, when first he saw",neg
"These hard and shining limbs, without a flaw,",neg
And cast his wonder in heroic mould.,neg
"Unhappy me who only may behold,",neg
Nor make immutable and fix in awe,neg
"A fair immortal form no worm shall gnaw,",neg
A tempered mind whose faith was never told!,neg
"The godlike mien, the lions lock and eye,",neg
"The well-knit sinew, utter a brave heart",neg
Better than many words that part by part,neg
Spell in strange symbols what serene and whole,neg
"In nature lives, nor can in marble die.",neg
The perfect body itself the soul.,neg
"I had come to the house, in a cave of trees,",neg
Facing a sheer sky.,neg
"Everything moved,a bell hung ready to strike,",neg
Sun and reflection wheeled by.,neg
When the bare eyes were before me,neg
"And the hissing hair,",neg
"Held up at a window, seen through a door.",neg
"The stiff bald eyes, the serpents on the forehead",neg
Formed in the air.,neg
This is a dead scene forever now.,neg
Nothing will ever stir.,neg
"The end will never brighten it more than this,",neg
Nor the rain blur.,neg
"The water will always fall, and will not fall,",neg
And the tipped bell make no sound.,neg
The grass will always be growing for hay,neg
Deep on the ground.,neg
And I shall stand here like a shadow,neg
"Under the great balanced day,",neg
"My eyes on the yellow dust, that was lifting in the wind,",neg
"And does not drift away.There may be chaos still around the world,",neg
This little world that in my thinking lies;,neg
For mine own bosom is the paradise,neg
Where all my lifes fair visions are unfurled.,neg
"Within my natures shell I slumber curled,",neg
"Unmindful of the changing outer skies,",neg
"Where now, perchance, some new-born Eros flies,",neg
Or some old Cronos from his throne is hurled.,neg
I heed them not; or if the subtle night,neg
"Haunt me with deities I never saw,",neg
I soon mine eyelids drowsy curtain draw,neg
To hide their myriad faces from my sight.,neg
They threat in vain; the whirlwind cannot awe,neg
A happy snow-flake dancing in the flaw.,neg
"Another's a half-cracked fellowJohn Heydon,",neg
"Worker of miracles, dealer in levitation,",neg
"In thoughts upon pure form, in alchemy,",neg
"Seer of pretty visions (""servant of God and secretary of nature"");",neg
"Full of plaintive charm, like Botticelli's,",neg
"With half-transparent forms, lacking the vigor of gods.",neg
"Thus Heydon, in a trance, at Bulverton,",neg
Had such a sight:,neg
"Decked all in green, with sleeves of yellow silk",neg
"Slit to the elbow, slashed with various purples.",neg
"Her eyes were green as glass, her foot was leaf-like.",neg
"She was adorned with choicest emeralds,",neg
And promised him the way of holy wisdom.,neg
"Pretty green bank, began the half-lost poem.",neg
"Take the old way, say I met John Heydon,",neg
"Sought out the place,",neg
"Lay on the bank, was ""plunged deep in swevyn;""",neg
"And saw the companyLayamon, Chaucer",neg
Pass each in his appropriate robes;,neg
"Conversed with each, observed the varying fashion.",neg
And then comes Heydon.,neg
I have seen John Heydon.,neg
Let us hear John Heydon!,neg
"Omnis intellectus est""thus he begins, by spouting half of Psellus.",neg
"(Then comes a note, my assiduous commentator:",neg
"Not Psellus De Daemonibus, but Porphyry's Chances,",neg
"In the thirteenth chapter, that ""every intellect is omni-form."")",neg
"Magnifico Lorenzo used the dodge,",neg
Says that he met Ficino,neg
"In some Wordsworthian, false-pastoral manner,",neg
"And that they walked along, stopped at a well-head,",neg
And heard deep platitudes about contentment,neg
From some old codger with an endless beard.,neg
"A daemon is not a particular intellect,
But is a substance differed from intellect,",neg
"Breaks in Ficino,",neg
Placed in the latitude or locus of souls,neg
"That's out of Proclus, take your pick of them.",neg
"Valla, more earth and sounder rhetoric",neg
Prefacing praise to his Pope Nicholas:,neg
"A man of parts, skilled in the subtlest sciences;
A patron of the arts, of poetry; and of a fine discernment.",neg
"Then comes a catalogue, his jewels of conversation.",neg
"No, you've not read your Elegantiae",neg
A dull book?shook the church.,neg
"The prefaces, cut clear and hard:",neg
"Know then the Roman speech, a sacrament,",neg
"Spread for the nations, eucharist of wisdom,",neg
Bread of the liberal arts.,neg

Sordello would have your heart to give to all the princes;,neg
"Valla, the heart of Rome,",neg
"Sustaining speech, set out before the people.",neg
"Marius, Du Bellay, wept for the buildings,",neg
Baldassar Castiglione saw Raphael,neg
"Lead back the soul into its dead, waste dwelling,",neg
"Corpore laniato; and Lorenzo Valla,",neg
"Broken in middle life? bent to submission?
Took a fat living from the Papacy",neg
"(That's in Villari, but Burckhardt's statement is different)",neg
"More than the Roman city, the Roman speech",neg
(Holds fast its part among the ever-living).,neg
Not by the eagles only was Rome measured.,neg
"Wherever the Roman speech was, there was Rome,",neg
"Wherever the speech crept, there was mastery",neg
"Spoke with the law's voice while your Greek, logicians...",neg

"Caught up his cadence, word and syllable:",neg
"Down to the ships we went, set mast and sail,
Black keel and beasts for bloody sacrifice,
Weeping we went.",neg
"I've strained my ear for -ensa, -ombra, and -ensa",neg
And cracked my wit on delicate canzoni,neg
Here's but rough meaning:,neg
"And then went down to the ship, set keel to breakers,",neg
Forth on the godly sea;,neg
"We set up mast and sail on the swarthy ship,",neg
"Sheep bore we aboard her, and our bodies also",neg
Heavy with weeping. And winds from sternward,neg
Bore us out onward with bellying canvas,neg
"Circe's this craft, the trim-coifed goddess.",neg
"Then sat we amidships, wind jamming the tiller.",neg
Thus with stretched sail,neg
We went over sea till day's end:,neg
"Sun to his slumber, shadows o'er all the ocean.",neg
"Came we then to the bounds of deepest water,",neg
To the Kimmerian lands and peopled cities,neg
"Covered with close-webbed mist, unpierced ever",neg
"With glitter of sun-rays,",neg
"Nor with stars stretched, nor looking back from heaven,",neg
Swartest night stretched over wretched men there.,neg
"Thither we in that ship, unladed sheep there,",neg
"The ocean flowing backward, came we through to the place",neg
Aforesaid by Circe.,neg
"Here did they rites, Perimedes and Eurylochus,",neg
And drawing sword from my hip,neg
"I dug the ell-square pitkin, poured we libations unto each the dead,",neg
"First mead and then sweet wine,",neg
Water mixed with white flour.,neg
Then prayed I many a prayer to the sickly death's-heads,neg
"As set in Ithaca, sterile bulls of the best,",neg
"For sacrifice, heaping the pyre with goods.",neg
"Sheep, to Tiresias only,",neg
"Black, and a bell sheep;",neg
Dark blood flowed in the fosse.,neg
"Souls out of Erebus, cadaverous dead",neg
"Of brides, of youths, and of many passing old,",neg
"Virgins tender, souls stained with recent tears,",neg
"Many men mauled with bronze lance-heads,",neg
"Battle spoil, bearing yet dreary arms:",neg
"These many crowded about me,",neg
"With shouting, pallor upon me, cried to my men for more beasts;",neg
"Slaughtered the herdssheep slain of bronze,",neg
"Poured ointment, cried to the gods,",neg
"To Pluto the strong, and praised Proserpine.",neg
"Unsheathed the narrow steel,",neg
"I sat to keep off the impetuous, impotent dead",neg
Till I should hear Tiresias.,neg
"But first Elpenor came, our friend Elpenor,",neg
"Unburied, cast on the wide earth",neg
"Limbs that we left in the house of Circe,",neg
"Unwept, unwrapped in sepulchre, since toils urged other,",neg
Pitiful spiritand I cried in hurried speech:,neg
"'Elpenor, how art thou come to this dark coast?",neg
"Cam'st thou afoot, outstripping seamen?' And he in heavy speech:",neg
"'Ill fate and abundant wine! I slept in Circe's ingle,",neg

A man of no fortune and with a name to come;,neg
"And set my oar up, that I swung 'mid fellows.'",neg
"Came then another ghost, whom I beat off, Anticlea,",neg

"Holding his golden wand, knew me and spoke first:",neg
"'Man of ill hour, why come a second time,",neg
"Leaving the sunlight, facing the sunless dead and this joyless region?",neg
"Stand from the fosse, move back, leave me my bloody bever,",neg
And I will speak you true speeches.',neg
"And I stepped back,",neg
Sheathing the yellow sword. Dark blood he drank then,neg
"And spoke: 'Lustrous Odysseus, shalt",neg
"Return through spiteful Neptune, over dark seas,",neg
Lose all companions.' Foretold me the ways and the signs.,neg
"Came then Anticlea, to whom I answered:",neg
'Fate drives me on through these deeps; I sought Tiresias.',neg
"I told her news of Troy, and thrice her shadow",neg
Faded in my embrace.,neg
Then had I news of many faded women,neg
"Tyro, Alcmena, Chloris",neg
"Heard out their tales by that dark fosse, and sailed",neg
"Light on the foam, breathed on by zephyrs,",neg
"And air-tending hours. Mirthful, orichalci, with golden",neg
Girdles and breast bands.,neg
"Thou with dark eye-lids,",neg
Bearing the golden bough of Argicida.,neg
"My love looks like a girl to-night,",neg
But she is old.,neg
The plaits that lie along her pillow,neg
"Are not gold,",neg
"But threaded with filigree silver,",neg
And uncanny cold.,neg
"She looks like a young maiden, since her brow",neg
"Is smooth and fair,",neg
"Her cheeks are very smooth, her eyes are closed.",neg
She sleeps a rare,neg
"Still winsome sleep, so still, and so composed.",neg
"Nay, but she sleeps like a bride, and dreams her dreams",neg
Of perfect things.,neg
"She lies at last, the darling, in the shape of her dream,",neg
And her dead mouth sings,neg
"By its shape, like the thrushes in clear evenings.I",neg
The mind has shown itself at times,neg
Too much the baked and labeled dough,neg
Divided by accepted multitudes.,neg
Across the stacked partitions of the day,neg
"Across the memoranda, baseball scores,",neg
The stenographic smiles and stock quotations,neg
Smutty wings flash out equivocations.,neg
The mind is brushed by sparrow wings;,neg
"Numbers, rebuffed by asphalt, crowd",neg
"The margins of the day, accent the curbs,",neg
Convoying divers dawns on every corner,neg
"To druggist, barber and tobacconist,",neg
Until the graduate opacities of evening,neg
Take them away as suddenly to somewhere,neg
"Virginal perhaps, less fragmentary, cool.",neg
There is the world dimensional for,neg
those untwisted by the love of things,neg
"And yet, suppose some evening I forgot",neg
"The fare and transfer, yet got by that way",neg
"Without recall,lost yet poised in traffic.",neg
"Then I might find your eyes across an aisle,",neg
Still flickering with those prefigurations,neg
"Prodigal, yet uncontested now,",neg
Half-riant before the jerky window frame.,neg
"There is some way, I think, to touch",neg
Those hands of yours that count the nights,neg
Stippled with pink and green advertisements.,neg
"And now, before its arteries turn dark",neg
I would have you meet this bartered blood.,neg
"Imminent in his dream, none better knows",neg
"The white wafer cheek of love, or offers words",neg
Lightly as moonlight on the eaves meets snow.,neg
Reflective conversion of all things,neg
"At your deep blush, when ecstasies thread",neg
"The limbs and belly, when rainbows spread",neg
Impinging on the throat and sides ...   ,neg
"Inevitable, the body of the world",neg
Weeps in inventive dust for the hiatus,neg
"That winks above it, bluet in your breasts.",neg
The earth may glide diaphanous to death;,neg
But if I lift my arms it is to bend,neg
"To you who turned away once, Helen, knowing",neg
"The press of troubled hands, too alternate",neg
With steel and soil to hold you endlessly.,neg
"I meet you, therefore, in that eventual flame",neg
"You found in final chains, no captive then",neg
"Beyond their million brittle, bloodshot eyes;",neg
"White, through white cities passed on to assume",neg
That world which comes to each of us alone.,neg
"Accept a lone eye riveted to your plane,",neg
Bent axle of devotion along companion ways,neg
"That beat, continuous, to hourless days",neg
"One inconspicuous, glowing orb of praise.",neg
Brazen hypnotics glitter here;,neg
"Glee shifts from foot to foot,",neg
Magnetic to their tremulo.,neg
"This crashing opera bouffe,",neg
Blest excursion! this ricochet,neg
From roof to roof,neg
"Know, Olympians, we are breathless",neg
While nigger cupids scour the stars!,neg
A thousand light shrugs balance us,neg
Through snarling hails of melody.,neg
White shadows slip across the floor,neg
Splayed like cards from a loose hand;,neg
Rhythmic ellipses lead into canters,neg
Until somewhere a rooster banters.,neg
Greet naivelyyet intrepidly,neg
"New soothings, new amazements",neg
That cornets introduce at every turn,neg
And you may fall downstairs with me,neg
With perfect grace and equanimity.,neg
"Or, plaintively scud past shores",neg
"Where, by strange harmonic laws",neg
"All relatives, serene and cool,",neg
Sit rocked in patent armchairs.,neg
"O,I have known metallic paradises",neg
Where cuckoos clucked to finches,neg
Above the deft catastrophes of drums.,neg
While titters hailed the groans of death,neg
Beneath gyrating awnings I have seen,neg
The incunabula of the divine grotesque.,neg
This music has a reassuring way.,neg
The siren of the springs of guilty song,neg
Let us take her on the incandescent wax,neg
"Striated with nuances, nervosities",neg
"That we are heir to: she is still so young,",neg
"We cannot frown upon her as she smiles,",neg
Dipping here in this cultivated storm,neg
Among slim skaters of the gardened skies.,neg
Capped arbiter of beauty in this street,neg
"That narrows darkly into motor dawn,",neg
"You, here beside me, delicate ambassador",neg
Of intricate slain numbers that arise,neg
"In whispers, naked of steel;",neg
religious gunman!,neg
"Who faithfully, yourself, will fall too soon,",neg
And in other ways than as the wind settles,neg
On the sixteen thrifty bridges of the city:,neg
Let us unbind our throats of fear and pity.,neg
"We even,",neg
Who drove speediest destruction,neg
"In corymbulous formations of mechanics,",neg
"Who hurried the hill breezes, spouting malice",neg
"Plangent over meadows, and looked down",neg
On rifts of torn and empty houses,neg
Like old women with teeth unjubilant,neg
"That waited faintly, briefly and in vain:",neg
"We know, eternal gunman, our flesh remembers",neg
"The tensile boughs, the nimble blue plateaus,",neg
"The mounted, yielding cities of the air!",neg
That saddled sky that shook down vertical,neg
Repeated play of fireno hypogeum,neg
Of wave or rock was good against one hour.,neg
"We did not ask for that, but have survived,",neg
And will persist to speak again before,neg
All stubble streets that have not curved,neg
"To memory, or known the ominous lifted arm",neg
That lowers down the arc of Helens brow,neg
To saturate with blessing and dismay.,neg
"A goose, tobacco and cologne",neg
"Three winged and gold-shod prophecies of heaven,",neg
The lavish heart shall always have to leaven,neg
"And spread with bells and voices, and atone",neg
The abating shadows of our conscript dust.,neg
"Anchises navel, dripping of the sea,",neg
"The hands Erasmus dipped in gleaming tides,",neg
Gathered the voltage of blown blood and vine;,neg
"Delve upward for the new and scattered wine,",neg
"O brother-thief of time, that we recall.",neg
Laugh out the meager penance of their days,neg
"Who dare not share with us the breath released,",neg
The substance drilled and spent beyond repair,neg
"For golden, or the shadow of gold hair.",neg
"Distinctly praise the years, whose volatile",neg
Blamed bleeding hands extend and thresh the height,neg
"The imagination spans beyond despair,",neg
"Outpacing bargain, vocable and prayer.",neg
We passed old farmer Boothby in the field.,neg
Rugged and straight he stood; his body steeled,neg
With stubbornness and age. We met his eyes,neg
"That never flinched or turned to compromise,",neg
"And Luck, he cried, good luck!and waved an arm,",neg
"Knotted and sailor-like, such as no farm",neg
In all of Maine could boast of; and away,neg
He turned again to pitch his new-cut hay...,neg
We walked on leisurely until a bend,neg
"Showed him once more, now working toward the end",neg
Of one great path; wearing his eighty years,neg
Like banners lifted in a wind of cheers.,neg
Then we turned off abruptlytook the road,neg
"Cutting the village, the one with the commanding",neg
View of the river. And we strode,neg
More briskly now to the long pier that showed,neg
Where the frail boats were kept at Indian Landing.,neg
In the canoe we stepped; our paddles dipped,neg
"Leisurely downwards, and the slim bark slipped",neg
More on than in the water. Smoothly then,neg
"We shot its nose against the rippling current,",neg
Feeling the rising rivers half-deterrent,neg
Pull on the paddle as we turned the blade,neg
To keep from swerving round; while we delayed,neg
To watch the curious wave-eaten locks;,neg
"Or pass, with lazy turns, the picnic-rocks....",neg
"Blue eels flew under us, and fishes darted",neg
A thousand ways; the once broad channel shrunk.,neg
And over us the wise and noble-hearted,neg
"Twilight leaned down; the sunset mists were parted,",neg
"And we, with thoughts on tiptoe, slunk",neg
"Down the green, twisting alleys of the Kennebunk,",neg
Motionless in the meadows,neg
"The trees, the rocks, the cows...",neg
And quiet dripped from the shadows,neg
Like rain from heavy boughs.,neg
The tree-toads started ringing,neg
Their ceaseless silver bells;,neg
A land-locked breeze came swinging,neg
Its censer of earthy smells.,neg
The rivers tiny canon,neg
Stretched into dusky lands;,neg
Like a dark and silent companion,neg
Evening held out her hands.,neg
Hushed were the dawns bravados;,neg
Loud noon was a silenced cry,neg
And quiet slipped from the shadows,neg
As stars slip out of the sky...,neg
"It must have been an hour more, or later,",neg
"When, tramping homeward through the piney wood,",neg
We felt the years fly back; the brotherhood,neg
Of forests took usand we saw the satyr!,neg
"There in a pool, up to his neck, he stood",neg
"And grinned to see us stare, incredulous",neg
Too startled to remember fear or flight.,neg
"Feeling the menace in the crafty night,",neg
"We turned to runwhen lo, he called to us!",neg
Using our very names he called. We drew,neg
With creaking courage down the avenue,neg
"Of birches till we saw, with clearing sight,",neg
"(No longer through a tricky, pale-green light)",neg
"Familiar turns and shrubs, the friendly path,",neg
And Farmer Boothby in his woodland bath!,neg
The woods became his background; every tree,neg
"Seemed part of him, and stood erect, and shared",neg
The beauty of that gnarled serenity;,neg
The quiet vigor of age that smiled and squared,neg
Its shoulders against Time ... And even night,neg
"Flowed in and out of him, as though content",neg
With such a native element;,neg
Happy to move about a spirit quite,neg
"As old, as placid and as confident...",neg
Sideways we turned. Still glistening and unclad,neg
"He leaped up on the bank, light as a lad,",neg
His body in the moonlight dripping stars...,neg
"We went on homeward, through the pasture-bars.",neg
"Living, I had no might",neg
"To make you hear,",neg
"Now, in the inmost night,",neg
I am so near,neg
"No whisper, falling light,",neg
"Divides us, dear.",neg
"Living, I had no claim",neg
On your great hours.,neg
"Now the thin candle-flame,",neg
"The closing flowers,",neg
"Wed summer with my name, ",neg
And these are ours.,neg
"Your shadow on the dust,",neg
"Strength, and a cry,",neg
"Delight, despair, mistrust, ",neg
All these am I.,neg
"Dawn, and the far hills thrust",neg
To a far sky.,neg
"Living, I had no skill",neg
"To stay your tread,",neg
Now all that was my will,neg
Silence has said.,neg
We are one for good and ill,neg
"Since I am dead.Momus is the name men give your face,",neg
"The brag of its tone, like a long low steamboat whistle",neg
"Finding a way mid mist on a shoreland,",neg
"Where gray rocks let the salt water shatter spray Against horizons purple, silent.",neg
"Yes, Momus,",neg
Men have flung your face in bronze,neg
To gaze in gargoyle downward on a street-whirl of folk.,neg
"They were artists did this, shaped your sad mouth,",neg
"Gave you a tall forehead slanted with calm, broad wisdom;",neg
All your lips to the corners and your cheeks to the high bones,neg
"Thrown over and through with a smile that forever wishes and wishes, purple, silent, fled from all the iron things of life, evaded like a sought bandit, gone into dreams, by God.",neg
"I wonder, Momus,",neg
Whether shadows of the dead sit somewhere and look with deep laughter,neg
"On men who play in terrible earnest the old, known, solemn repetitions of history.",neg
"A droning monotone soft as sea laughter hovers from your kindliness of bronze,",neg
"You give me the human ease of a mountain peak, purple, silent;",neg
"Granite shoulders heaving above the earth curves,",neg
Careless eye-witness of the spawning tides of men and women,neg
"Swarming always in a drift of millions to the dust of toil, the salt of tears,",neg
"And blood drops of undiminishing war.Potuia, potuia",neg
"White grave goddess,",neg
"Pity my sadness,",neg
O silence of Paros.,neg
"I am not of these about thy feet,",neg
These garments and decorum;,neg
"I am thy brother,",neg
"Thy lover of aforetime crying to thee,",neg
And thou hearest me not.,neg
I have whispered thee in thy solitudes,neg
"Of our loves in Phrygia,",neg
The far ecstasy of burning noons,neg
When the fragile pipes,neg
"Ceased in the cypress shade,",neg
And the brown fingers of the shepherd,neg
Moved over slim shoulders;,neg
And only the cicada sang.,neg
I have told thee of the hills,neg
And the lisp of reeds,neg
"And the sun upon thy breasts,",neg
"And thou hearest me not,",neg
"Potuia, potuia",neg
Thou hearest me not.The ancient songs,neg
Pass deathward mournfully.,neg
"Cold lips that sing no more, and withered wreaths,",neg
"Regretful eyes, and drooping breasts and wings",neg
Symbols of ancient songs,neg
Mournfully passing,neg
"Down to the great white surges,",neg
Watched of none         - -,neg
Save the frail sea-birds,neg
"And the lithe pale girls,",neg
Daughters of Okeanos.,neg
And the songs pass,neg
From the green land,neg
Which lies upon the waves as a leaf,neg
On the flowers of hyacinth;,neg
"And they pass from the waters,",neg
"The manifold winds and the dim moon,",neg
"And they come,",neg
"Silently winging through soft Kimmerian dusk,",neg
To the quiet level lands,neg
"That she keeps for us all,",neg
That she wrought for us all for sleep,neg
In the silver days of the earth's dawning,neg
"Proserpine, daughter of Zeus.",neg
"And we turn from the Kuprian's breasts,",neg
"And we turn from thee,",neg
"Phoibos Apollon,",neg
And we turn from the music of old,neg
"And the hills that we loved and the meads,",neg
"And we turn from the fiery day,",neg
And the lips that were over-sweet;,neg
For silently,neg
"Brushing the fields with red-shod feet,",neg
With purple robe,neg
"Searing the flowers as with a sudden flame,",neg
"Death,",neg
Thou hast come upon us.,neg
And of all the ancient songs,neg
Passing to the swallow-blue halls,neg
"By the dark streams of Persephone,",neg
This only remains:,neg
"That in the end we turn to thee,",neg
"Death,",neg
"That we turn to thee, singing",neg
One last song.,neg
"O Death,",neg
Thou art an healing wind,neg
That blowest over white flowers,neg
A-tremble with dew;,neg
Thou art a wind flowing,neg
Over long leagues of lonely sea;,neg
Thou art the dusk and the fragrance;,neg
Thou art the lips of love mournfully smiling;,neg
Thou art the pale peace of one,neg
Satiate with old desires;,neg
"Thou art the silence of beauty,",neg
And we look no more for the morning;,neg
"We yearn no more for the sun,",neg
"Since with thy white hands,",neg
"Death,",neg
"Thou crownest us with the pallid chaplets,",neg
The slim colorless poppies,neg
Which in thy garden alone,neg
Softly thou gatherest.,neg
And silently;,neg
And with slow feet approaching;,neg
"And with bowed head and unlit eyes,",neg
We kneel before thee:,neg
"And thou, leaning towards us, Caressingly layest upon us",neg
"Flowers from thy thin cold hands,",neg
"And, smiling as a chaste woman Knowing love in her heart,",neg
Thou sealest our eyes,neg
And the illimitable quietude,neg
Comes gently upon us.,neg
Knock knock He has closed his door,neg
The gardens lilies have started to rot,neg
So who is the corpse being carried from the house,neg
You just knocked on his door,neg
And trot trot,neg
Trot goes little lady mouse,neg
Translated from the French I have built a house in the middle of the Ocean,neg
Its windows are the rivers flowing from my eyes,neg
Octopi are crawling all over where the walls are,neg
Hear their triple hearts beat and their beaks peck against the windowpanes,neg
House of dampness,neg
House of burning,neg
Seasons fastness,neg
Season singing,neg
The airplanes are laying eggs,neg
Watch out for the dropping of the anchor,neg
Watch out for the shooting black ichor,neg
It would be good if you were to come from the sky,neg
The skys honeysuckle is climbing,neg
The earthly octopi are throbbing,neg
And so very many of us have become our own gravediggers,neg
Pale octopi of the chalky waves O octopi with pale beaks,neg
Around the house is this ocean that you know well,neg
  And is never still,neg
"Translated from the French Wallace Stevens,",neg
"O sweet everlasting Voices, be still;",neg
Go to the guards of the heavenly fold,neg
"And bid them wander obeying your will,",neg
"Flame under flame, till Time be no more;",neg
"Have you not heard that our hearts are old,",neg
"That you call in birds, in wind on the hill,",neg
"In shaken boughs, in tide on the shore?",neg
"O sweet everlasting Voices, be still. Although you hide in the ebb and flow",neg
"Of the pale tide when the moon has set,",neg
The people of coming days will know,neg
"About the casting out of my net,",neg
And how you have leaped times out of mind,neg
"Over the little silver cords,",neg
"And think that you were hard and unkind,",neg
"And blame you with many bitter words.She that but little patience knew,",neg
"From childhood on, had now so much",neg
A grey gull lost its fear and flew,neg
"Down to her cell and there alit,",neg
And there endured her fingers' touch,neg
And from her fingers ate its bit.,neg
Did she in touching that lone wing,neg
Recall the years before her mind,neg
"Became a bitter, an abstract thing,",neg
Her thought some popular enmity:,neg
Blind and leader of the blind,neg
Drinking the foul ditch where they lie?,neg
When long ago I saw her ride,neg
"Under Ben Bulben to the meet,",neg
The beauty of her country-side,neg
"With all youth's lonely wildness stirred,",neg
She seemed to have grown clean and sweet,neg
"Like any rock-bred, sea-borne bird:",neg
"Sea-borne, or balanced in the air",neg
When first it sprang out of the nest,neg
Upon some lofty rock to stare,neg
"Upon the cloudy canopy,",neg
While under its storm-beaten breast,neg
"Cried out the hollows of the sea.There was a man whom Sorrow named his friend,",neg
"And he, of his high comrade Sorrow dreaming,",neg
Went walking with slow steps along the gleaming,neg
"And humming sands, where windy surges wend:",neg
And he called loudly to the stars to bend,neg
"From their pale thrones and comfort him, but they",neg
Among themselves laugh on and sing alway:,neg
And then the man whom Sorrow named his friend,neg
"Cried out, Dim sea, hear my most piteous story!",neg
"The sea swept on and cried her old cry still,",neg
Rolling along in dreams from hill to hill.,neg
He fled the persecution of her glory,neg
"And, in a far-off, gentle valley stopping,",neg
Cried all his story to the dewdrops glistening.,neg
"But naught they heard, for they are always listening,",neg
"The dewdrops, for the sound of their own dropping.",neg
And then the man whom Sorrow named his friend,neg
"Sought once again the shore, and found a shell,",neg
"And thought, I will my heavy story tell",neg
"Till my own words, re-echoing, shall send",neg
"Their sadness through a hollow, pearly heart;",neg
"And my own tale again for me shall sing,",neg
"And my own whispering words be comforting,",neg
And lo! my ancient burden may depart.,neg
Then he sang softly nigh the pearly rim;,neg
But the sad dweller by the sea-ways lone,neg
Changed all he sang to inarticulate moan,neg
"Among her wildering whirls, forgetting him. The woods of Arcady are dead,",neg
And over is their antique joy;,neg
Of old the world on dreaming fed;,neg
Grey Truth is now her painted toy;,neg
Yet still she turns her restless head:,neg
"But O, sick children of the world,",neg
Of all the many changing things,neg
"In dreary dancing past us whirled,",neg
"To the cracked tune that Chronos sings,",neg
Words alone are certain good.,neg
"Where are now the warring kings,",neg
Word be-mockers?  By the Rood,neg
Where are now the warring kings?,neg
"An idle word is now their glory,",neg
"By the stammering schoolboy said,",neg
Reading some entangled story:,neg
The kings of the old time are dead;,neg
The wandering earth herself may be,neg
"Only a sudden flaming word,",neg
"In clanging space a moment heard,",neg
Troubling the endless reverie.,neg
"Then nowise worship dusty deeds,",neg
"Nor seek, for this is also sooth,",neg
"To hunger fiercely after truth,",neg
Lest all thy toiling only breeds,neg
"New dreams, new dreams; there is no truth",neg
"Saving in thine own heart. Seek, then,",neg
"No learning from the starry men,",neg
Who follow with the optic glass,neg
The whirling ways of stars that pass  ,neg
"Seek, then, for this is also sooth,",neg
No word of theirs  the cold star-bane,neg
"Has cloven and rent their hearts in twain,",neg
And dead is all their human truth.,neg
Go gather by the humming sea,neg
"Some twisted, echo-harbouring shell,",neg
"And to its lips thy story tell,",neg
"And they thy comforters will be,",neg
Rewarding in melodious guile,neg
"Thy fretful words a little while,",neg
Till they shall singing fade in ruth,neg
And die a pearly brotherhood;,neg
For words alone are certain good:,neg
"Sing, then, for this is also sooth.",neg
I must be gone: there is a grave,neg
"Where daffodil and lily wave,",neg
"And I would please the hapless faun,",neg
"Buried under the sleepy ground,",neg
With mirthful songs before the dawn.,neg
His shouting days with mirth were crowned;,neg
"And still I dream he treads the lawn,",neg
"Walking ghostly in the dew,",neg
"Pierced by my glad singing through,",neg
My songs of old earth's dreamy youth:,neg
But ah! she dreams not now; dream thou!,neg
For fair are poppies on the brow:,neg
"Dream, dream, for this is also sooth.",neg
Only the wanderer,neg
"Knows England's graces,",neg
Or can anew see clear,neg
Familiar faces.,neg
And who loves joy as he,neg
That dwells in shadows?,neg
"Do not forget me quite,",neg
"O Severn meadows.He's gone, and all our plans",neg
Are useless indeed.,neg
We'll walk no more on Cotswold,neg
Where the sheep feed,neg
Quietly and take no heed.,neg
His body that was so quick,neg
Is not as you,neg
"Knew it, on Severn river",neg
Under the blue,neg
Driving our small boat through.,neg
You would not know him now ...,neg
But still he died,neg
"Nobly, so cover him over",neg
With violets of pride,neg
Purple from Severn side.,neg
"Cover him, cover him soon!",neg
And with thick-set,neg
Masses of memoried flowers,neg
Hide that red wet,neg
Thing I must somehow forget.By a peninsula the painter sat and,neg
Sketched the uneven valley groves.,neg
The apostle gave alms to the,neg
Meek. The volcano burst,neg
In fusive sulphur and hurled,neg
Rocks and ore into the air,neg
Heavens sudden change at,neg
"The drawing tempestuous,",neg
Darkening shade of dense clouded hues.,neg
The wanderer soon chose,neg
His spot of rest; they bore the,neg
"Chosen hero upon their shoulders,",neg
"Whom they strangely admired, as",neg
The beach-tide summer of people desired.Is this the river East I heard?,neg
"Where the ferries, tugs and sailboats stirred",neg
And the reaching wharves from the inner land,neg
"Ourstretched, like the harmless receiving hand",neg
And the silvery tinge that sparkles aloud,neg
"Like the brilliant white demons, which a tide has towed",neg
From the rays of the morning sun,neg
Which it doth ceaselessly shine upon.,neg
But look at the depth of the drippling tide,neg
"The dripples, reripples like the locusts astride;",neg
As the boat turns upon the silvery spread,neg
It leavesstrangea shadow dead.,neg
And the very charms from the reflective river,neg
And from the stacks of the floating boat,neg
There seemeth the quality neer to dissever,neg
Like the ruffles from the mystified smoke. The motion of gathering loops of water,neg
Must either burst or remain in a moment.,neg
The violet colors through the glass,neg
Throw up little swellings that appear,neg
And spatter as soon as another strikes,neg
And is born; so pure are they of colored,neg
"Hues, that we feel the absent strength",neg
Of its power. When they begin they gather,neg
Like sand on the beach: each bubble,neg
"Contains a complete eye of water.I went out to the hazel wood,",neg
"Because a fire was in my head,",neg
"And cut and peeled a hazel wand,",neg
And hooked a berry to a thread;,neg
"And when white moths were on the wing,",neg
"And moth-like stars were flickering out,",neg
I dropped the berry in a stream,neg
And caught a little silver trout.,neg
When I had laid it on the floor,neg
"I went to blow the fire a-flame,",neg
"But something rustled on the floor,",neg
And someone called me by my name:,neg
It had become a glimmering girl,neg
With apple blossom in her hair,neg
Who called me by my name and ran,neg
And faded through the brightening air.,neg
Though I am old with wandering,neg
"Through hollow lands and hilly lands,",neg
"I will find out where she has gone,",neg
And kiss her lips and take her hands;,neg
"And walk among long dappled grass,",neg
"And pluck till time and times are done,",neg
"The silver apples of the moon,",neg
The golden apples of the sun.,neg
Barque of phosphor,neg
"On the palmy beach,",neg
"Move outward into heaven,",neg
Into the alabasters,neg
And night blues.,neg
Foam and cloud are one.,neg
Sultry moon-monsters,neg
Are dissolving.,neg
Fill your black hull,neg
With white moonlight.,neg
There will never be an end,neg
To this droning of the surf.The trade-wind jingles the rings in the nets around the racks by the docks on Indian River.,neg
"It is the same jingle of the water among roots under the banks of the palmettoes,",neg
It is the same jingle of the red-bird breasting the orange-treesout of the cedars.,neg
"Yet there is no spring in Florida, neither in boskage perdu, nor on the nunnery beaches. Her terrace was the sand",neg
And the palms and the twilight.,neg
She made of the motions of her wrist,neg
The grandiose gestures,neg
Of her thought.,neg
The rumpling of the plumes,neg
Of this creature of the evening,neg
Came to be sleights of sails,neg
Over the sea.,neg
And thus she roamed,neg
"In the roamings of her fan,",neg
"Partaking of the sea,",neg
"And of the evening,",neg
As they flowed around,neg
And uttered their subsiding sound.As the immense dew of Florida,neg
Brings forth,neg
The big-finned palm,neg
"And green vine angering for life,",neg
As the immense dew of Florida,neg
Brings forth hymn and hymn,neg
"From the beholder,",neg
Beholding all these green sides,neg
"And gold sides of green sides,",neg
"And blessed mornings,",neg
"Meet for the eye of the young alligator,",neg
And lightning colors,neg
"So, in me, come flinging",neg
"Forms, flames, and the flakes of flames.",neg
"The moon has left the sky, love,",neg
"The stars are hiding now,",neg
"And frowning on the world, love,",neg
Night bares her sable brow.,neg
"The snow is on the ground, love,",neg
And cold and keen the air is.,neg
"Im singing here to you, love;",neg
Youre dreaming there in Paris.,neg
"But this is Natures law, love,",neg
"Though just it may not seem,",neg
"That men should wake to sing, love;",neg
While maidens sleep and dream.,neg
"Them care may not molest, love,",neg
"Nor stir them from their slumbers,",neg
"Though midnight find the swain, love.",neg
Still halting oer his numbers.,neg
"I watch the rosy dawn, love,",neg
"Come stealing up the east,",neg
"While all things round rejoice, love,",neg
That Night her reign has ceased.,neg
"The lark will soon be heard, love,",neg
And on his way be winging;,neg
"When Natures poets, wake, love,",neg
Why should a man be singing?The buffaloes are gone.,neg
And those who saw the buffaloes are gone.,neg
"Those who saw the buffaloes by thousands and how they pawed the prairie sod into dust with their hoofs, their great heads down pawing on in a great pageant of dusk,",neg
Those who saw the buffaloes are gone.,neg
And the buffaloes are gone.There is a wolf in me . . . fangs pointed for tearing gashes . . . a red tongue for raw meat . . . and the hot lapping of bloodI keep this wolf because the wilderness gave it to me and the wilderness will not let it go.    ,neg

Furrow of all our traveltrailed derision!,neg
Eyes crumble at its kiss. Its long-drawn spell,neg
Incites a yell. Slid on that backward vision,neg
"The mind is churned to spittle, whispering hell.",neg
I wanted you . . . The embers of the Cross,neg
Climbed by aslant and huddling aromatically.,neg
It is blood to remember; it is fire,neg
To stammer back . . . It is,neg
Godyour namelessness. And the wash,neg
All night the water combed you with black,neg
"Insolence. You crept out simmering, accomplished.",neg
"Water rattled that stinging coil, your",neg
"Rehearsed hairdocile, alas, from many arms.",neg
"Yes, Evewraith of my unloved seed!",neg

Light drowned the lithic trillions of your spawn.,neg

"The salt, salt smell of the thick sea air,",neg
"And the smooth round stones that the ebbtides wear,",neg
When will the good ship come?,neg
"The wretched stumps all charred and burned,",neg
"And the deep soft rut where the cartwheel turned,",neg
Why is the world so old?,neg

"Where the cawing crows and the slow gulls fly,",neg
Where are the dead untold?,neg

What will become of man?Guillaume Apollinaire.,neg
While my hair was still cut straight across my forehead,neg
"I played about the front gate, pulling flowers.",neg
"You came by on bamboo stilts, playing horse,",neg
"You walked about my seat, playing with blue plums.",neg
And we went on living in the village of Chokan:,neg
"Two small people, without dislike or suspicion.",neg
At fourteen I married My Lord you.,neg
"I never laughed, being bashful.",neg
"Lowering my head, I looked at the wall.",neg
"Called to, a thousand times, I never looked back.",neg
"At fifteen I stopped scowling,",neg
I desired my dust to be mingled with yours,neg

Why should I climb the look out?,neg
At sixteen you departed,neg

And you have been gone five months.,neg
The monkeys make sorrowful noise overhead.,neg
You dragged your feet when you went out.,neg

In these few hours of light I lift my head;,neg
Life is my loverI shall leave the dead,neg
If there is any way to baffle death.,neg
"I know what the caged bird feels, alas!",neg
When the sun is bright on the upland slopes;   ,neg
"When the wind stirs soft through the springing grass,   ",neg
And the river flows like a stream of glass;,neg
"When the first bird sings and the first bud opes,   ",neg
And the faint perfume from its chalice steals,neg
I know what the caged bird feels!,neg
I know why the caged bird beats his wing,neg
Till its blood is red on the cruel bars;   ,neg
For he must fly back to his perch and cling   ,neg
When he fain would be on the bough a-swing;,neg
"And a pain still throbs in the old, old scars   ",neg
And they pulse again with a keener sting,neg
I know why he beats his wing!,neg
"I know why the caged bird sings, ah me,",neg
"When his wing is bruised and his bosom sore,",neg
When he beats his bars and he would be free;,neg
"It is not a carol of joy or glee,",neg
"But a prayer that he sends from his hearts deep core,   ",neg
"But a plea, that upward to Heaven he flings",neg
I know why the caged bird sings!,neg
"There may be chaos still around the world,",neg
This little world that in my thinking lies;,neg
For mine own bosom is the paradise,neg
Where all my lifes fair visions are unfurled.,neg
"Within my natures shell I slumber curled,",neg
"Unmindful of the changing outer skies,",neg
"Where now, perchance, some new-born Eros flies,",neg
Or some old Cronos from his throne is hurled.,neg
I heed them not; or if the subtle night,neg
"Haunt me with deities I never saw,",neg
I soon mine eyelids drowsy curtain draw,neg
To hide their myriad faces from my sight.,neg
They threat in vain; the whirlwind cannot awe,neg
A happy snow-flake dancing in the flaw.I,neg
"Among twenty snowy mountains,",neg
The only moving thing,neg
Was the eye of the blackbird.,neg
"I was of three minds,",neg
Like a tree,neg
In which there are three blackbirds.,neg
The blackbird whirled in the autumn winds.,neg
It was a small part of the pantomime.,neg
A man and a woman,neg
Are one.,neg
A man and a woman and a blackbird   ,neg
Are one.,neg
"I do not know which to prefer,",neg
The beauty of inflections,neg
"Or the beauty of innuendoes,",neg
The blackbird whistling,neg
Or just after.,neg
Icicles filled the long window,neg
With barbaric glass.,neg
The shadow of the blackbird,neg
"Crossed it, to and fro.",neg
The mood,neg
Traced in the shadow,neg
An indecipherable cause.,neg
"O thin men of Haddam,",neg
Why do you imagine golden birds?,neg
Do you not see how the blackbird,neg
Walks around the feet,neg
Of the women about you?,neg
I know noble accents,neg
"And lucid, inescapable rhythms;",neg
"But I know, too,",neg
That the blackbird is involved,neg
In what I know.,neg
"When the blackbird flew out of sight,",neg
It marked the edge,neg
Of one of many circles.,neg
At the sight of blackbirds,neg
"Flying in a green light,",neg
Even the bawds of euphony,neg
Would cry out sharply.,neg
He rode over Connecticut,neg
In a glass coach.,neg
"Once, a fear pierced him,",neg
In that he mistook,neg
The shadow of his equipage,neg
For blackbirds.,neg
The river is moving.,neg
The blackbird must be flying.,neg
It was evening all afternoon.,neg
It was snowing,neg
And it was going to snow.,neg
The blackbird sat,neg
In the cedar-limbs.I,neg
"Calm was the sea to which your course you kept,",neg
"Oh, how much calmer than all southern seas!",neg
"Many your nameless mates, whom the keen breeze",neg
Wafted from mothers that of old have wept.,neg
All souls of children taken as they slept,neg
"Are your companions, partners of your ease,",neg
And the green souls of all these autumn trees,neg
Are with you through the silent spaces swept.,neg
Your virgin body gave its gentle breath,neg
"Untainted to the gods. Why should we grieve,",neg
But that we merit not your holy death?,neg
"We shall not loiter long, your friends and I;",neg
"Living you made it goodlier to live,",neg
Dead you will make it easier to die.,neg
With you a part of me hath passed away;,neg
For in the peopled forest of my mind,neg
A tree made leafless by this wintry wind,neg
Shall never don again its green array.,neg
"Chapel and fireside, country road and bay,",neg
Have something of their friendliness resigned;,neg
"Another, if I would, I could not find,",neg
And I am grown much older in a day.,neg
But yet I treasure in my memory,neg
"Your gift of charity, your mellow ease,",neg
And the dear honour of your amity;,neg
"For these once mine, my life is rich with these.",neg
"And I scarce know which part may greater be,",neg
"What I keep of you, or you rob of me.",neg
Your bark lies anchored in the peaceful bight,neg
Until a kinder wind unfurl her sail;,neg
"Your docile spirit, winged by this gale,",neg
Hath at the dawning fled into the light.,neg
And I half know why heaven deemed it right,neg
"Your youth, and this my joy in youth, should fail;",neg
"God hath them still, for ever they avail,",neg
Eternity hath borrowed that delight.,neg
For long ago I taught my thoughts to run,neg
"Where all the great things live that lived of yore,",neg
And in eternal quiet float and soar;,neg
"There all my loves are gathered into one,",neg
"Where change is not, nor parting any more,",neg
Nor revolution of the moon and sun.,neg
In my deep heart these chimes would still have rung,neg
"To toll your passing, had you not been dead;",neg
For time a sadder mask than death may spread,neg
Over the face that ever should be young.,neg
The bough that falls with all its trophies hung,neg
"Falls not too soon, but lays its flower-crowned head",neg
"Most royal in the dust, with no leaf shed",neg
Unhallowed or unchiselled or unsung.,neg
And though the after world will never hear,neg
"The happy name of one so gently true,",neg
"Nor chronicles write large this fatal year,",neg
"Yet we who loved you, though we be but few,",neg
"Keep you in whatsoeer is good, and rear",neg
In our weak virtues monuments to you.,neg
But then there comes that moment rare,neg
"When, for no cause that I can find,",neg
The little voices of the air,neg
Sound above all the sea and wind.,neg
The sea and wind do then obey,neg
"And sighing, sighing double notes",neg
"Of double basses, content to play",neg
A droning chord for the little throats,neg
The little throats that sing and rise,neg
Up into the light with lovely ease,neg
"And a kind of magical, sweet surprise",neg
To hear and know themselves for these,neg
"For these little voices: the bee, the fly,",neg
"The leaf that taps, the pod that breaks,",neg
"The breeze on the grass-tops bending by,",neg
The shrill quick sound that the insect makes,neg
"Even iron can put forth,",neg
Even iron.,neg
"This is the iron age,",neg
But let us take heart,neg
"Seeing iron break and bud,",neg
Seeing rusty iron puff with clouds of blossom.,neg
"The almond-tree,",neg
December's bare iron hooks sticking out of earth.,neg
"The almond-tree,",neg
"That knows the deadliest poison, like a snake",neg
In supreme bitterness.,neg
"Upon the iron, and upon the steel,",neg
"Odd flakes as if of snow, odd bits of snow,",neg
Odd crumbs of melting snow.,neg
"But you mistake, it is not from the sky;",neg
"From out the iron, and from out the steel,",neg
"Flying not down from heaven, but storming up,",neg
Strange storming up from the dense under-earth,neg
"Along the iron, to the living steel",neg
"In rose-hot tips, and flakes of rose-pale snow",neg
Setting supreme annunciation to the world.,neg
"Nay, what a heart of delicate super-faith,",neg
"Iron-breaking,",neg
The rusty swords of almond-trees.,neg
"Trees suffer, like races, down the long ages.",neg
"They wander and are exiled, they live in exile through long ages",neg
"Like drawn blades never sheathed, hacked and gone black,",neg
The alien trees in alien lands: and yet,neg
"The heart of blossom,",neg
The unquenchable heart of blossom!,neg
"Look at the many-cicatrised frail vine, none more scarred and frail,",neg
Yet see him fling himself abroad in fresh abandon,neg
From the small wound-stump.,neg
"Even the wilful, obstinate, gummy fig-tree",neg
"Can be kept down, but he'll burst like a polyp into prolixity.",neg
"And the almond-tree, in exile, in the iron age!",neg
"This is the ancient southern earth whence the vases were baked, amphoras, craters, cantharus, oenochoe, and open-hearted cylix,",neg
Bristling now with the iron of almond-trees,neg
"Iron, but unforgotten,",neg
"Iron, dawn-hearted,",neg
"Ever-beating dawn-heart, enveloped in iron against the exile, against the ages.",neg
See it come forth in blossom,neg
From the snow-remembering heart,neg
"In long-nighted January,",neg
"In the long dark nights of the evening star, and Sirius, and the Etna snow-wind through the long night.",neg
Sweating his drops of blood through the long-nighted Gethsemane,neg
"Into blossom, into pride, into honey-triumph, into most exquisite splendour.",neg
"Oh, give me the tree of life in blossom",neg
And the Cross sprouting its superb and fearless flowers!,neg
"Something must be reassuring to the almond, in the evening star, and the snow-wind, and the long, long, nights,",neg
"Some memory of far, sun-gentler lands,",neg
So that the faith in his heart smiles again,neg
"And his blood ripples with that untenable delight of once-more-vindicated faith,",neg
"And the Gethsemane blood at the iron pores unfolds, unfolds,",neg
Pearls itself into tenderness of bud,neg
"And in a great and sacred forthcoming steps forth, steps out in one stride",neg
"A naked tree of blossom, like a bridegroom bathing in dew, divested of cover,",neg
"Frail-naked, utterly uncovered",neg
"To the green night-baying of the dog-star, Etna's snow-edged wind",neg
And January's loud-seeming sun.,neg
"Think of it, from the iron fastness",neg
"Suddenly to dare to come out naked, in perfection of blossom, beyond the sword-rust.",neg
"Think, to stand there in full-unfolded nudity, smiling,",neg
"With all the snow-wind, and the sun-glare, and the dog-star baying epithalamion.",neg
"Oh, honey-bodied beautiful one,",neg
"Come forth from iron,",neg
Red your heart is.,neg
"Fragile-tender, fragile-tender life-body,",neg
"More fearless than iron all the time,",neg
"And so much prouder, so disdainful of reluctances.",neg
"In the distance like hoar-frost, like silvery ghosts communing on a green hill,",neg
Hoar-frost-like and mysterious.,neg
In the garden raying out,neg
"With a body like spray, dawn-tender, and looking about",neg
"With such insuperable, subtly-smiling assurance,",neg
Sword-blade-born.,neg
"Unpromised,",neg
No bounds being set.,neg
"Flaked out and come unpromised,",neg
"The tree being life-divine,",neg
"Fearing nothing, life-blissful at the core",neg
Within iron and earth.,neg
"Knots of pink, fish-silvery",neg
"In heaven, in blue, blue heaven,",neg
"Soundless, bliss-full, wide-rayed, honey-bodied,",neg
"Red at the core,",neg
"Red at the core,",neg
Knotted in heaven upon the fine light.,neg
"Open,",neg
"Open,",neg
"Five times wide open,",neg
"Six times wide open,",neg
"And given, and perfect;",neg
"And red at the core with the last sore-heartedness,",neg
Sore-hearted-looking.,neg
"At evening, sitting on this terrace,",neg
"When the sun from the west, beyond Pisa, beyond the mountains of Carrara",neg
"Departs, and the world is taken by surprise ...",neg
When the tired flower of Florence is in gloom beneath the glowing,neg
Brown hills surrounding ...,neg
When under the arches of the Ponte Vecchio,neg
"A green light enters against stream, flush from the west,",neg
Against the current of obscure Arno ...,neg
"Look up, and you see things flying",neg
Between the day and the night;,neg
Swallows with spools of dark thread sewing the shadows together.,neg
"A circle swoop, and a quick parabola under the bridge arches",neg
Where light pushes through;,neg
A sudden turning upon itself of a thing in the air.,neg
A dip to the water.,neg
And you think:,neg
The swallows are flying so late!,neg
Swallows?,neg
Dark air-life looping,neg
Yet missing the pure loop ...,neg
"A twitch, a twitter, an elastic shudder in flight",neg
"And serrated wings against the sky,",neg
"Like a glove, a black glove thrown up at the light,",neg
And falling back.,neg
Never swallows!,neg
Bats!,neg
The swallows are gone.,neg
At a wavering instant the swallows gave way to bats,neg
By the Ponte Vecchio ...,neg
Changing guard.,neg
"Bats, and an uneasy creeping in one's scalp",neg
As the bats swoop overhead!,neg
Flying madly.,neg
Pipistrello!,neg
Black piper on an infinitesimal pipe.,neg
"Little lumps that fly in air and have voices indefinite, wildly vindictive;",neg
Wings like bits of umbrella.,neg
Bats!,neg
"Creatures that hang themselves up like an old rag, to sleep;",neg
And disgustingly upside down.,neg
Hanging upside down like rows of disgusting old rags,neg
And grinning in their sleep.,neg
Bats!,neg
In China the bat is symbol for happiness.,neg
Not for me!Notes:,neg
"Then you shall see her truly--your blood remembering its first invasion of her secrecy, its first encounters with her kind, her chieftain lover...his shade that haunts the lakes and hills",neg
The bronze General Grant riding a bronze horse in Lincoln Park,neg
Shrivels in the sun by day when the motor cars whirr by in long processions going somewhere to keep apppointment for dinner and matinees and buying and selling,neg
Though in the dusk and nightfall when high waves are piling,neg
On the slabs of the promenade along the lake shore near by,neg
I have seen the general dare the combers come closer,neg
And make to ride his bronze horse out into the hoofs and guns of the storm.,neg
I cross Lincoln Park on a winter night when the snow is falling.,neg
"Lincoln in bronze stands among the white lines of snow, his bronze forehead meeting soft echoes of the newsies crying forty thousand men are dead along the Yser, his bronze ears listening to the mumbled roar of the city at his bronze feet.",neg
"A lithe Indian on a bronze pony, Shakespeare seated with long legs in bronze, Garibaldi in a bronze cape, they hold places in the cold, lonely snow to-night on their pedestals and so they will hold them past midnight and into the dawn.",neg
Not in that wasted garden,neg
Where bodies are drawn into grass,neg
"That feeds no flocks, and into evergreens",neg
That bear no fruit ,neg
There where along the shaded walks,neg
"Vain sighs are heard,",neg
And vainer dreams are dreamed,neg
Of close communion with departed souls ,neg
But here under the apple tree,neg
I loved and watched and pruned,neg
With gnarled hands,neg
"In the long, long years;",neg
Here under the roots of this northern-spy,neg
"To move in the chemic change and circle of life,",neg
"Into the soil and into the flesh of the tree,",neg
And into the living epitaphs,neg
"Of redder apples!What large, dark hands are those at the window",neg
"Lifted, grasping the golden light",neg
Which weaves its way through the creeper leaves,neg
To my heart's delight?,neg
"Ah, only the leaves! But in the west,",neg
In the west I see a redness come,neg
Over the evening's burning breast ,neg
'Tis the wound of love goes home!,neg
The woodbine creeps abroad,neg
Calling low to her lover:,neg
The sun-lit flirt who all the day,neg
Has poised above her lips in play,neg
"And stolen kisses, shallow and gay",neg
"Of pollen, now has gone away",neg
" She woos the moth with her sweet, low word,",neg
And when above her his broad wings hover,neg
Then her bright breast she will uncover,neg
And yield her honey-drop to her lover.,neg
"Into the yellow, evening glow",neg
"Saunters a man from the farm below,",neg
"Leans, and looks in at the low-built shed",neg
Where hangs the swallow's marriage bed.,neg
The bird lies warm against the wall.,neg
She glances quick her startled eyes,neg
"Towards him, then she turns away",neg
"Her small head, making warm display",neg
Of red upon the throat. His terrors sway,neg
"Her out of the nest's warm, busy ball,",neg
Whose plaintive cry is heard as she flies,neg
In one blue stoop from out the sties,neg
Into the evening's empty hall.,neg
"Oh, water-hen, beside the rushes",neg
"Hide your quaint, unfading blushes,",neg
"Still your quick tail, and lie as dead,",neg
Till the distance folds over his ominous tread.,neg
"The rabbit presses back her ears,",neg
"Turns back her liquid, anguished eyes",neg
And crouches low: then with wild spring,neg
Spurts from the terror of his oncoming,neg
"To be choked back, the wire ring",neg
Her frantic effort throttling:,neg
Piteous brown ball of quivering fears!,neg
"Ah soon in his large, hard hands she dies,",neg
And swings all loose to the swing of his walk.,neg
Yet calm and kindly are his eyes,neg
And ready to open in brown surprise,neg
Should I not answer to his talk,neg
Or should he my tears surmise.,neg
"I hear his hand on the latch, and rise from my chair",neg
Watching the door open: he flashes bare,neg
"His strong teeth in a smile, and flashes his eyes",neg
In a smile like triumph upon me; then careless-wise,neg
He flings the rabbit soft on the table board,neg
"And comes towards me: ah, the uplifted sword",neg
"Of his hand against my bosom, and oh, the broad",neg
Blade of his hand that raises my face to applaud,neg
His coming: he raises up my face to him,neg
"And caresses my mouth with his fingers, which still smell grim",neg
"Of the rabbit's fur! God, I am caught in a snare!",neg
"I know not what fine wire is round my throat,",neg
I only know I let him finger there,neg
"My pulse of life, letting him nose like a stoat",neg
Who sniffs with joy before he drinks the blood:,neg
"And down his mouth comes to my mouth, and down",neg
His dark bright eyes descend like a fiery hood,neg
"Upon my mind: his mouth meets mine, and a flood",neg
"Of sweet fire sweeps across me, so I drown",neg
"Within him, die, and find death good.",neg
"See, the grass is full of stars,",neg
Fallen in their brightness;,neg
"Hearts they have of shining gold,",neg
Rays of shining whiteness.,neg
"Buttercups have honeyed hearts,",neg
"Bees they love the clover,",neg
But I love the daisies' dance,neg
All the meadow over.,neg
"Blow, O blow, you happy winds,",neg
"Singing summer's praises,",neg
Up the field and down the field,neg
A-dancing with the daisies.,neg
"This spring as it comes bursts up in bonfires green,",neg
"Wild puffing of emerald trees, and flame-filled bushes,",neg
Thorn-blossom lifting in wreaths of smoke between,neg
"Where the wood fumes up and the watery, flickering rushes.",neg
"I am amazed at this spring, this conflagration",neg
"Of green fires lit on the soil of the earth, this blaze",neg
"Of growing, and sparks that puff in wild gyration,",neg
Faces of people streaming across my gaze.,neg
"And I, what fountain of fire am I among",neg
This leaping combustion of spring? My spirit is tossed,neg
About like a shadow buffeted in the throng,neg
"Of flames, a shadow that's gone astray, and is lost.I never knew the earth had so much gold",neg
"The fields run over with it, and this hill",neg
"Hoary and old,",neg
Is young with buoyant blooms that flame and thrill.,neg
"Such golden fires, such yellowlo, how good",neg
"This spendthrift world, and what a lavish God!",neg
"This fringe of wood,",neg
Blazing with buttercup and goldenrod.,neg
"You too, beloved, are changed. Again I see",neg
"Your face grow mystical, as on that night",neg
"You turned to me,",neg
And all the trembling worldand youwere white.,neg
"Aye, you are touched; your singing lips grow dumb;",neg
"The fields absorb you, color you entire . . .",neg
And you become,neg
A goddess standing in a world of fire!The fog comes,neg
on little cat feet.,neg
It sits looking,neg
over harbor and city,neg
on silent haunches,neg
and then moves on.,neg
When she rises in the morning,neg
I linger to watch her;,neg
She spreads the bath-cloth underneath the window,neg
And the sunbeams catch her,neg
"Glistening white on the shoulders,",neg
While down her sides the mellow,neg
Golden shadow glows as,neg
"She stoops to the sponge, and her swung breasts",neg
Sway like full-blown yellow,neg
Gloire de Dijon roses.,neg
"She drips herself with water, and her shoulders",neg
"Glisten as silver, they crumple up",neg
"Like wet and falling roses, and I listen",neg
For the sluicing of their rain-dishevelled petals.,neg
In the window full of sunlight,neg
Concentrates her golden shadow,neg
"Fold on fold, until it glows as",neg
"Mellow as the glory roses.Pray why are you so bare, so bare,",neg
"Oh, bough of the old oak-tree;",neg
"And why, when I go through the shade you throw,",neg
Runs a shudder over me?,neg
"My leaves were green as the best, I trow,",neg
"And sap ran free in my veins,",neg
But I say in the moonlight dim and weird,neg
A guiltless victim's pains.,neg
I bent me down to hear his sigh;,neg
"I shook with his gurgling moan,",neg
"And I trembled sore when they rode away,",neg
And left him here alone.,neg
"They'd charged him with the old, old crime,",neg
And set him fast in jail:,neg
"Oh, why does the dog howl all night long,",neg
And why does the night wind wail?,neg
"He prayed his prayer and he swore his oath,",neg
And he raised his hand to the sky;,neg
"But the beat of hoofs smote on his ear,",neg
And the steady tread drew nigh.,neg
"Who is it rides by night, by night,",neg
Over the moonlit road?,neg
"And what is the spur that keeps the pace,",neg
What is the galling goad?,neg
"And now they beat at the prison door,",neg
"Ho, keeper, do not stay!",neg
"We are friends of him whom you hold within,",neg
And we fain would take him away,neg
From those who ride fast on our heels,neg
With mind to do him wrong;,neg
"They have no care for his innocence,",neg
And the rope they bear is long.,neg
"They have fooled the jailer with lying words,",neg
They have fooled the man with lies;,neg
"The bolts unbar, the locks are drawn,",neg
And the great door open flies.,neg
"Now they have taken him from the jail,",neg
"And hard and fast they ride,",neg
"And the leader laughs low down in his throat,",neg
As they halt my trunk beside.,neg
"Oh, the judge, he wore a mask of black,",neg
"And the doctor one of white,",neg
"And the minister, with his oldest son,",neg
Was curiously bedight.,neg
"Oh, foolish man, why weep you now?",neg
"'Tis but a little space,",neg
And the time will come when these shall dread,neg
The mem'ry of your face.,neg
"I feel the rope against my bark,",neg
"And the weight of him in my grain,",neg
I feel in the throe of his final woe,neg
The touch of my own last pain.,neg
And never more shall leaves come forth,neg
On the bough that bears the ban;,neg
"I am burned with dread, I am dried and dead,",neg
From the curse of a guiltless man.,neg
"And ever the judge rides by, rides by,",neg
"And goes to hunt the deer,",neg
And ever another rides his soul,neg
In the guise of a mortal fear.,neg
"And ever the man he rides me hard,",neg
And never a night stays he;,neg
"For I feel his curse as a haunted bough,",neg
On the trunk of a haunted tree.When I am dead and over me bright April,neg
"Shakes out her rain-drenched hair,",neg
"Tho' you should lean above me broken-hearted,",neg
I shall not care.,neg
"I shall have peace, as leafy trees are peaceful",neg
"When rain bends down the bough,",neg
And I shall be more silent and cold-hearted,neg
Than you are now.in Just-,neg
spring when the world is mud-,neg
luscious the little,neg
lame balloonman,neg
whistles far and wee,neg
and eddieandbill come,neg
running from marbles and,neg
piracies and it's,neg
spring,neg
when the world is puddle-wonderful,neg
the queer,neg
old balloonman whistles,neg
far and wee,neg
and bettyandisbel come dancing,neg
from hop-scotch and jump-rope and,neg
it's spring and the goat-footed balloonMan whistles,neg
"I will arise and go now, and go to Innisfree,",neg
"And a small cabin build there, of clay and wattles made;",neg
"Nine bean-rows will I have there, a hive for the honey-bee,",neg
And live alone in the bee-loud glade.,neg
"And I shall have some peace there, for peace comes dropping slow,",neg
Dropping from the veils of the morning to where the cricket sings;,neg
"There midnights all a glimmer, and noon a purple glow,",neg
And evening full of the linnets wings.,neg
"I will arise and go now, for always night and day",neg
I hear lake water lapping with low sounds by the shore;,neg
"While I stand on the roadway, or on the pavements grey,",neg
I hear it in the deep hearts core.,neg
little tree,neg
little silent Christmas tree,neg
you are so little,neg
you are more like a flower,neg
who found you in the green forest,neg
and were you very sorry to come away?,neg
see i will comfort you,neg
because you smell so sweetly,neg
i will kiss your cool bark,neg
and hug you safe and tight,neg
"just as your mother would,",neg
only don't be afraid,neg
look the spangles,neg
that sleep all the year in a dark box,neg
"dreaming of being taken out and allowed to shine,",neg
"the balls the chains red and gold the fluffy threads,",neg
put up your little arms,neg
and i'll give them all to you to hold,neg
every finger shall have its ring,neg
and there won't be a single place dark or unhappy,neg
then when you're quite dressed,neg
you'll stand in the window for everyone to see,neg
and how they'll stare!,neg
oh but you'll be very proud,neg
and my little sister and i will take hands,neg
and looking up at our beautiful tree,neg
we'll dance and sing,neg
Rugged and straight he stood; his body steeled,neg
With stubbornness and age. We met his eyes,neg
"That never flinched or turned to compromise,",neg
"And Luck, he cried, good luck!and waved an arm,",neg
"Knotted and sailor-like, such as no farm",neg
In all of Maine could boast of; and away,neg
He turned again to pitch his new-cut hay...,neg
We walked on leisurely until a bend,neg
"Showed him once more, now working toward the end",neg
Of one great path; wearing his eighty years,neg
Like banners lifted in a wind of cheers.,neg
Then we turned off abruptlytook the road,neg
"Cutting the village, the one with the commanding",neg
View of the river. And we strode,neg
More briskly now to the long pier that showed,neg
Where the frail boats were kept at Indian Landing.,neg
In the canoe we stepped; our paddles dipped,neg
"Leisurely downwards, and the slim bark slipped",neg
More on than in the water. Smoothly then,neg
"We shot its nose against the rippling current,",neg
Feeling the rising rivers half-deterrent,neg
Pull on the paddle as we turned the blade,neg
To keep from swerving round; while we delayed,neg
To watch the curious wave-eaten locks;,neg
"Or pass, with lazy turns, the picnic-rocks....",neg
"Blue eels flew under us, and fishes darted",neg
A thousand ways; the once broad channel shrunk.,neg
And over us the wise and noble-hearted,neg
"Twilight leaned down; the sunset mists were parted,",neg
"And we, with thoughts on tiptoe, slunk",neg
"Down the green, twisting alleys of the Kennebunk,",neg
Motionless in the meadows,neg
"The trees, the rocks, the cows...",neg
And quiet dripped from the shadows,neg
Like rain from heavy boughs.,neg
The tree-toads started ringing,neg
Their ceaseless silver bells;,neg
A land-locked breeze came swinging,neg
Its censer of earthy smells.,neg
The rivers tiny canon,neg
Stretched into dusky lands;,neg
Like a dark and silent companion,neg
Evening held out her hands.,neg
Hushed were the dawns bravados;,neg
Loud noon was a silenced cry,neg
And quiet slipped from the shadows,neg
As stars slip out of the sky...,neg
"It must have been an hour more, or later,",neg
"When, tramping homeward through the piney wood,",neg
We felt the years fly back; the brotherhood,neg
Of forests took usand we saw the satyr!,neg
"There in a pool, up to his neck, he stood",neg
"And grinned to see us stare, incredulous",neg
Too startled to remember fear or flight.,neg
"Feeling the menace in the crafty night,",neg
"We turned to runwhen lo, he called to us!",neg
Using our very names he called. We drew,neg
With creaking courage down the avenue,neg
"Of birches till we saw, with clearing sight,",neg
"(No longer through a tricky, pale-green light)",neg
"Familiar turns and shrubs, the friendly path,",neg
And Farmer Boothby in his woodland bath!,neg
The woods became his background; every tree,neg
"Seemed part of him, and stood erect, and shared",neg
The beauty of that gnarled serenity;,neg
The quiet vigor of age that smiled and squared,neg
Its shoulders against Time ... And even night,neg
"Flowed in and out of him, as though content",neg
With such a native element;,neg
Happy to move about a spirit quite,neg
"As old, as placid and as confident...",neg
Sideways we turned. Still glistening and unclad,neg
"He leaped up on the bank, light as a lad,",neg
His body in the moonlight dripping stars...,neg
"We went on homeward, through the pasture-bars.Moonmoth and grasshopper that flee our page",neg
"And still wing on, untarnished of the name",neg
We pinion to your bodies to assuage,neg
Our envy of your freedomwe must maim,neg
"Because we are usurpers, and chagrined",neg
And take the wing and scar it in the hand.,neg
"Names we have, even, to clap on the wind;",neg
"But we must die, as you, to understand.",neg
"I dreamed that all men dropped their names, and sang",neg
"As only they can praise, who build their days",neg
"With fin and hoof, with wing and sweetened fang",neg
Struck free and holy in one Name always.,neg
She has no need to fear the fall,neg
Of harvest from the laddered reach,neg
"Of orchards, nor the tide gone ebbing",neg
From the steep beach.,neg
Nor hold to pain's effrontery,neg
"Her body's bulwark, stern and savage,",neg
"Nor be a glass, where to forsee",neg
Another's ravage.,neg
"What she has gathered, and what lost,",neg
She will not find to lose again.,neg
"She is possessed by time, who once",neg
Was loved by men.,neg
The winter evening settles down,neg
With smell of steaks in passageways.,neg
Six oclock.,neg
The burnt-out ends of smoky days.,neg
And now a gusty shower wraps,neg
The grimy scraps,neg
Of withered leaves about your feet,neg
And newspapers from vacant lots;,neg
The showers beat,neg
"On broken blinds and chimney-pots,",neg
And at the corner of the street,neg
A lonely cab-horse steams and stamps.,neg
And then the lighting of the lamps.,neg
The morning comes to consciousness,neg
Of faint stale smells of beer,neg
From the sawdust-trampled street,neg
With all its muddy feet that press,neg
To early coffee-stands.,neg
With the other masquerades,neg
"That time resumes,",neg
One thinks of all the hands,neg
That are raising dingy shades,neg
In a thousand furnished rooms.,neg
"You tossed a blanket from the bed,",neg
"You lay upon your back, and waited;",neg
"You dozed, and watched the night revealing",neg
The thousand sordid images,neg
Of which your soul was constituted;,neg
They flickered against the ceiling.,neg
And when all the world came back,neg
And the light crept up between the shutters,neg
"And you heard the sparrows in the gutters,",neg
You had such a vision of the street,neg
As the street hardly understands;,neg
"Sitting along the beds edge, where",neg
"You curled the papers from your hair,",neg
Or clasped the yellow soles of feet,neg
In the palms of both soiled hands.,neg
His soul stretched tight across the skies,neg
"That fade behind a city block,",neg
Or trampled by insistent feet,neg
At four and five and six oclock;,neg
"And short square fingers stuffing pipes,",neg
"And evening newspapers, and eyes",neg
"Assured of certain certainties,",neg
The conscience of a blackened street,neg
Impatient to assume the world.,neg
I am moved by fancies that are curled,neg
"Around these images, and cling:",neg
The notion of some infinitely gentle,neg
Infinitely suffering thing.,neg
"Wipe your hand across your mouth, and laugh;",neg
The worlds revolve like ancient women,neg
"Gathering fuel in vacant lots.The willows carried a slow sound,",neg
A sarabande the wind mowed on the mead.,neg
I could never remember,neg
"That seething, steady leveling of the marshes",neg
Till age had brought me to the sea.,neg
"Flags, weeds. And remembrance of steep alcoves",neg
Where cypresses shared the noons,neg
Tyranny; they drew me into hades almost.,neg
And mammoth turtles climbing sulphur dreams,neg
"Yielded, while sun-silt rippled them",neg
Asunder ...,neg
How much I would have bartered! the black gorge,neg
And all the singular nestings in the hills,neg
Where beavers learn stitch and tooth.,neg
The pond I entered once and quickly fled,neg
I remember now its singing willow rim.,neg
"And finally, in that memory all things nurse;",neg
After the city that I finally passed,neg
With scalding unguents spread and smoking darts,neg
The monsoon cut across the delta,neg
"At gulf gates ... There, beyond the dykes",neg
"I heard wind flaking sapphire, like this summer,",neg
And willows could not hold more steady sound.Twelve o'clock.,neg
Along the reaches of the street,neg
"Held in a lunar synthesis,",neg
Whispering lunar incantations,neg
Dissolve the floors of memory,neg
"And all its clear relations,",neg
"Its divisions and precisions,",neg
Every street lamp that I pass,neg
"Beats like a fatalistic drum,",neg
And through the spaces of the dark,neg
Midnight shakes the memory,neg
As a madman shakes a dead geranium.,neg
"Half-past one,",neg
"The street lamp sputtered,",neg
"The street lamp muttered,",neg
"The street lamp said, ""Regard that woman",neg
Who hesitates towards you in the light of the door,neg
Which opens on her like a grin.,neg
You see the border of her dress,neg
"Is torn and stained with sand,",neg
And you see the corner of her eye,neg
"Twists like a crooked pin.""",neg
The memory throws up high and dry,neg
A crowd of twisted things;,neg
A twisted branch upon the beach,neg
"Eaten smooth, and polished",neg
As if the world gave up,neg
"The secret of its skeleton,",neg
Stiff and white.,neg
"A broken spring in a factory yard,",neg
Rust that clings to the form that the strength has left,neg
Hard and curled and ready to snap.,neg
"Half-past two,",neg
"The street lamp said,",neg
"Remark the cat which flattens itself in the gutter,
Slips out its tongue
And devours a morsel of rancid butter.",neg
"So the hand of a child, automatic,",neg
Slipped out and pocketed a toy that was running along the quay.,neg
I could see nothing behind that child's eye.,neg
I have seen eyes in the street,neg
"Trying to peer through lighted shutters,",neg
"And a crab one afternoon in a pool,",neg
"An old crab with barnacles on his back,",neg
Gripped the end of a stick which I held him.,neg
"Half-past three,",neg
"The lamp sputtered,",neg
The lamp muttered in the dark.,neg
The lamp hummed:,neg
Regard the moon,neg
La lune ne garde aucune rancune,neg
She winks a feeble eye,neg
She smiles into corners.,neg
She smoothes the hair of the grass.,neg
The moon has lost her memory.,neg
A washed-out smallpox cracks her face,neg
Her hand twists a paper rose,neg
That smells of dust and old Cologne,neg
She is alone,neg
With all the old nocturnal smells,neg
That cross and cross across her brain.,neg
The reminiscence comes,neg
Of sunless dry geraniums,neg
"And dust in crevices,",neg
"Smells of chestnuts in the streets,",neg
"And female smells in shuttered rooms,",neg
And cigarettes in corridors,neg
"And cocktail smells in bars.""",neg
"The lamp said,",neg
"Four o'clock,",neg
Here is the number on the door.,neg
Memory!,neg
"You have the key,",neg
"The little lamp spreads a ring on the stair,",neg
Mount.,neg
"The bed is open; the tooth-brush hangs on the wall,",neg
"Put your shoes at the door, sleep, prepare for life.",neg
The last twist of the knife.,neg
"Out of the winds' and the waves' riot,",neg
"Out of the loud foam,",neg
He has put in to a great quiet,neg
And a still home.,neg
Here he may lie at ease and wonder,neg
"Why the old ship waits,",neg
And hark for the surge and the strong thunder,neg
"Of the full Straits,",neg
"And look for the fishing fleet at morning,",neg
"Shadows like lost souls,",neg
Slide through the fog where the seal's warning,neg
"Betrays the shoals,",neg
And watch for the deep-sea liner climbing,neg
"Out of the bright West,",neg
With a salmon-sky and her wake shining,neg
"Like a tern's breast, ",neg
And never know he is done for ever,neg
"With the old sea's pride,",neg
Borne from the fight and the full endeavour,neg
"On an ebb tide.Maurice, weep not, I am not here under this pine tree.",neg
"The balmy air of spring whispers through the sweet grass,",neg
"The stars sparkle, the whippoorwill calls,",neg
"But thou grievest, while my soul lies rapturous",neg
In the blest Nirvana of eternal light!,neg
"Go to the good heart that is my husband,",neg
Who broods upon what he calls our guilty love: i,neg
"Tell him that my love for you, no less than my love for him",neg
Wrought out my destiny i that through the flesh,neg
"I won spirit, and through spirit, peace.",neg
"There is no marriage in heaven,",neg
But there is love.,neg
The earth builds on the earth,neg
Castles and towers;,neg
The earth saith of the earth:,neg
All shall be ours.,neg
"Yea, though they plan and reap",neg
"The rye and the corn,",neg
"Lo, they were bond to Sleep",neg
Ere they were born.,neg
"Yea, though the blind earth sows",neg
"For the fruit and the sheaf,",neg
They shall harvest the leaf of the rose,neg
And the dust of the leaf.,neg
Pride of the sword and power,neg
Are theirs at their need,neg
Who shall rule but the root of the flower,neg
The fall of the seed.,neg
They who follow the flesh,neg
"In splendour and tears,",neg
They shall rest and clothe them afresh,neg
In the fulness of years.,neg
From the dream of the dust they came,neg
As the dawn set free.,neg
They shall pass as the flower of the flame,neg
Or the foam of the sea.,neg
The earth builds on the earth,neg
Castles and towers.,neg
The earth saith of the earth:,neg
"All shall be ours.May I for my own self song's truth reckon,",neg
"Journey's jargon, how I in harsh days",neg
Hardship endured oft.,neg
"Bitter breast-cares have I abided,",neg
"Known on my keel many a care's hold,",neg
"And dire sea-surge, and there I oft spent",neg
Narrow nightwatch nigh the ship's head,neg
"While she tossed close to cliffs. Coldly afflicted,",neg
My feet were by frost benumbed.,neg
Chill its chains are; chafing sighs,neg
Hew my heart round and hunger begot,neg
Mere-weary mood. Lest man know not,neg
"That he on dry land loveliest liveth,",neg
"List how I, care-wretched, on ice-cold sea,",neg
"Weathered the winter, wretched outcast",neg
Deprived of my kinsmen;,neg
"Hung with hard ice-flakes, where hail-scur flew,",neg
There I heard naught save the harsh sea,neg
"And ice-cold wave, at whiles the swan cries,",neg
"Did for my games the gannet's clamour,",neg
"Sea-fowls, loudness was for me laughter,",neg
The mews' singing all my mead-drink.,neg
"Storms, on the stone-cliffs beaten, fell on the stern",neg
In icy feathers; full oft the eagle screamed,neg
With spray on his pinion.,neg
Not any protector,neg
May make merry man faring needy.,neg
"This he little believes, who aye in winsome life",neg
"Abides 'mid burghers some heavy business,",neg
"Wealthy and wine-flushed, how I weary oft",neg
Must bide above brine.,neg
"Neareth nightshade, snoweth from north,",neg
"Frost froze the land, hail fell on earth then",neg
Corn of the coldest. Nathless there knocketh now,neg
The heart's thought that I on high streams,neg
The salt-wavy tumult traverse alone.,neg
Moaneth alway my mind's lust,neg
"That I fare forth, that I afar hence",neg
Seek out a foreign fastness.,neg
"For this there's no mood-lofty man over earth's midst,",neg
"Not though he be given his good, but will have in his youth greed;",neg
"Nor his deed to the daring, nor his king to the faithful",neg
But shall have his sorrow for sea-fare,neg
Whatever his lord will.,neg
"He hath not heart for harping, nor in ring-having",neg
"Nor winsomeness to wife, nor world's delight",neg
"Nor any whit else save the wave's slash,",neg
Yet longing comes upon him to fare forth on the water.,neg
"Bosque taketh blossom, cometh beauty of berries,",neg
"Fields to fairness, land fares brisker,",neg
"All this admonisheth man eager of mood,",neg
The heart turns to travel so that he then thinks,neg
On flood-ways to be far departing.,neg
"Cuckoo calleth with gloomy crying,",neg
"He singeth summerward, bodeth sorrow,",neg
The bitter heart's blood. Burgher knows not ,neg
He the prosperous man  what some perform,neg
Where wandering them widest draweth.,neg
"So that but now my heart burst from my breast-lock,",neg
"My mood 'mid the mere-flood,",neg
"Over the whale's acre, would wander wide.",neg
"On earth's shelter cometh oft to me,",neg
"Eager and ready, the crying lone-flyer,",neg
"Whets for the whale-path the heart irresistibly,",neg
O'er tracks of ocean; seeing that anyhow,neg
My lord deems to me this dead life,neg
"On loan and on land, I believe not",neg
That any earth-weal eternal standeth,neg
Save there be somewhat calamitous,neg
"That, ere a man's tide go, turn it to twain.",neg
Disease or oldness or sword-hate,neg
Beats out the breath from doom-gripped body.,neg
"And for this, every earl whatever, for those speaking after ",neg
"Laud of the living, boasteth some last word,",neg
"That he will work ere he pass onward,",neg
"Frame on the fair earth 'gainst foes his malice,",neg
"Daring ado, ...",neg
So that all men shall honour him after,neg
"And his laud beyond them remain 'mid the English,",neg
"Aye, for ever, a lasting life's-blast,",neg
Delight mid the doughty.,neg
"Days little durable,",neg
"And all arrogance of earthen riches,",neg
There come now no kings nor Csars,neg
Nor gold-giving lords like those gone.,neg
"Howe'er in mirth most magnified,",neg
"Whoe'er lived in life most lordliest,",neg
"Drear all this excellence, delights undurable!",neg
"Waneth the watch, but the world holdeth.",neg
Tomb hideth trouble. The blade is layed low.,neg
Earthly glory ageth and seareth.,neg
"No man at all going the earth's gait,",neg
"But age fares against him, his face paleth,",neg
"Grey-haired he groaneth, knows gone companions,",neg
"Lordly men are to earth o'ergiven,",neg
"Nor may he then the flesh-cover, whose life ceaseth,",neg
"Nor eat the sweet nor feel the sorry,",neg
"Nor stir hand nor think in mid heart,",neg
"And though he strew the grave with gold,",neg
"His born brothers, their buried bodies",neg
Be an unlikely treasure hoard.Out in the sky the great dark clouds are massing;,neg
"I look far out into the pregnant night,",neg
Where I can hear a solemn booming gun,neg
"And catch the gleaming of a random light,",neg
"That tells me that the ship I seek is passing, passing.",neg
My tearful eyes my soul's deep hurt are glassing;,neg
For I would hail and check that ship of ships.,neg
"I stretch my hands imploring, cry aloud,",neg
"My voice falls dead a foot from mine own lips,",neg
"And but its ghost doth reach that vessel, passing, passing.",neg
"O Earth, O Sky, O Ocean, both surpassing,",neg
"O heart of mine, O soul that dreads the dark!",neg
Is there no hope for me? Is there no way,neg
That I may sight and check that speeding bark,neg
"Which out of sight and sound is passing, passing? Air a-gittin' cool an' coolah,",neg
"Frost a-comin' in de night,",neg

"The brilliant moon and all the milky sky,   ",neg
"And all that famous harmony of leaves,   ",neg
Had blotted out man's image and his cry.,neg
A girl arose that had red mournful lips,neg
"And seemed the greatness of the world in tears,   ",neg
Doomed like Odysseus and the labouring ships   ,neg
And proud as Priam murdered with his peers;,neg
"Arose, and on the instant clamorous eaves,   ",neg
"A climbing moon upon an empty sky,   ",neg
"And all that lamentation of the leaves,   ",neg
"Could but compose man's image and his cry. Now in the West the slender moon lies low,",neg
"And now Orion glimmers through the trees,",neg
"Clearing the earth with even pace and slow,",neg
"And now the stately-moving Pleiades,",neg
In that soft infinite darkness overhead,neg
Hang jewel-wise upon a silver thread.,neg
"And all the lonelier stars that have their place,",neg
"Calm lamps within the distant southern sky,",neg
"And planet-dust upon the edge of space,",neg
"Look down upon the fretful world, and I",neg
Look up to outer vastness unafraid,neg
And see the stars which sang when earth was made.,neg
I spot the hills,neg
With yellow balls in autumn.,neg
I light the prairie cornfields,neg
Orange and tawny gold clusters,neg
And I am called pumpkins.,neg
On the last of October,neg
When dusk is fallen,neg
Children join hands,neg
And circle round me,neg
Singing ghost songs,neg
And love to the harvest moon;,neg
I am a jack-o'-lantern,neg
With terrible teeth,neg
And the children know,neg
I am fooling.Green miles of leafy peace are spread,neg
"Over these ranks, unseen and serried;",neg
Screening the trenches with their dead,neg
And living men already buried.,neg
"The rains beat down, the torrents flow",neg
Into each cold and huddling cave;,neg
"And over them the beet-fields grow,",neg
A fortress gentle as a grave.,neg
"Morose, impatient, sick at heart,",neg
"With rasping nerves and twitching muscles,",neg
We cannot even sleep; we start,neg
With every twig that snaps or rustles.,neg
Sought always by an unseen foe,neg
Over our heads the bullets fly;,neg
"But more than these, we fear the snow,",neg
The silent shrapnel of the sky.,neg
"Yonder our colonel stalks and grieves,",neg
Meeting the storm with thoughts more stormy;,neg
"But we, we sit and watch the leaves",neg
"Fall down, a torn and crumpled army.",neg
"We mourn for every leaf that lies,",neg
As though it were a comrade slain;,neg
Each was a shelter from the eyes,neg
Of every prying aeroplane. . . ,neg
"And in its cloudy uniform,",neg
"Stilling the cannons earthly thunder,",neg
The huge artillery of the storm,neg
Plows through the land and pulls it under.,neg
"The rain beats down, until the slow",neg
And slipping earth resists no more. . .,neg
And over them the beets will grow,neg
Ranker and redder than before.,neg
"The quick sparks on the gorse bushes are leaping,",neg
Little jets of sunlight-texture imitating flame;,neg
"Above them, exultant, the peewits are sweeping:",neg
They are lords of the desolate wastes of sadness their screamings proclaim.,neg
"Rabbits, handfuls of brown earth, lie",neg
Low-rounded on the mournful grass they have bitten down to the quick.,neg
"Are they asleep?  Are they alive?  Now see, when I",neg
Move my arms the hill bursts and heaves under their spurting kick.,neg
"The common flaunts bravely; but below, from the rushes",neg
Crowds of glittering king-cups surge to challenge the blossoming bushes;,neg
There the lazy streamlet pushes,neg
"Its curious course mildly; here it wakes again, leaps, laughs, and gushes.",neg
"Into a deep pond, an old sheep-dip,",neg
"Dark, overgrown with willows, cool, with the brook ebbing through so slow,",neg
"Naked on the steep, soft lip",neg
Of the bank I stand watching my own white shadow quivering to and fro.,neg
What if the gorse flowers shrivelled and kissing were lost?,neg
"Without the pulsing waters, where were the marigolds and the songs of the brook!",neg
If my veins and my breasts with love embossed,neg
"Withered, my insolent soul would be gone like flowers that the hot wind took.",neg
"So my soul like a passionate woman turns,",neg
"Filled with remorseful terror to the man she scorned, and her love",neg
"For myself in my own eyes' laughter burns,",neg
Runs ecstatic over the pliant folds rippling down to my belly from the breast-lights above.,neg
"Over my sunlit skin the warm, clinging air,",neg
"Rich with the songs of seven larks singing at once, goes kissing me glad.",neg
And the soul of the wind and my blood compare,neg
"Their wandering happiness, and the wind, wasted in liberty, drifts on and is sad.",neg
"Oh but the water loves me and folds me,",neg
"Plays with me, sways me, lifts me and sinks me as though it were living blood,",neg
"Blood of a heaving woman who holds me,",neg
"Owning my supple body a rare glad thing, supremely good.",neg
The quick sparks on the gorse-bushes are leaping,neg
Little jets of sunlight texture imitating flame;,neg
"Above them, exultant, the peewits are sweeping:",neg
"They have triumphed again o'er the ages, their screamings proclaim.",neg
"Rabbits, handfuls of brown earth, lie",neg
Low-rounded on the mournful turf they have bitten down to the quick.,neg
"Are they asleep?  are they living?  Now see, when I",neg
"Lift my arms, the hill bursts and heaves under their spurting kick!",neg
"The common flaunts bravely; but below, from the rushes",neg
Crowds of glittering king-cups surge to challenge the blossoming bushes;,neg
There the lazy streamlet pushes,neg
"His bent course mildly; here wakes again, leaps, laughs, and gushes",neg
"Into a deep pond, an old sheep-dip,",neg
"Dark, overgrown with willows, cool, with the brook ebbing through so slow;",neg
"Naked on the steep, soft lip",neg
Of the turf I stand watching my own white shadow quivering to and fro.,neg
"What if the gorse-flowers shrivelled, and I were gone?",neg
"What if the waters ceased, where were the marigolds then, and the gudgeon?",neg
What is this thing that I look down upon?,neg
"White on the water wimples my shadow, strains like a dog on a string, to run on.",neg
"How it looks back, like a white dog to its master!",neg
"I on the bank all substance, my shadow all shadow looking up to me, looking back!",neg
"And the water runs, and runs faster, runs faster,",neg
"And the white dog dances and quivers, I am holding his cord quite slack.",neg
"But how splendid it is to be substance, here!",neg
"My shadow is neither here nor there; but I, I am royally here!",neg
I am here! I am here! screams the peewit; the may-blobs burst out in a laugh as they hear!,neg
Here! flick the rabbits. Here! pants the gorse. Here! say the insects far and near.,neg
"Over my skin in the sunshine, the warm, clinging air",neg
"Flushed with the songs of seven larks singing at once, goes kissing me glad.",neg
You are here! You are here! We have found you! Everywhere,neg
"We sought you substantial, you touchstone of caresses, you naked lad!",neg
"Oh but the water loves me and folds me,",neg
"Plays with me, sways me, lifts me and sinks me, murmurs: Oh marvellous stuff!",neg
No longer shadow!  and it holds me,neg
"Close, and it rolls me, enfolds me, touches me, as if never it could touch me enough.",neg
"Sun, but in substance, yellow water-blobs!",neg
"Wings and feathers on the crying, mysterious ages, peewits wheeling!",neg
"All that is right, all that is good; all that is God takes substance! a rabbit lobs",neg
"In confirmation, I hear sevenfold lark-songs pealing.The trees are in their autumn beauty,",neg
"The woodland paths are dry,",neg
Under the October twilight the water,neg
Mirrors a still sky;,neg
Upon the brimming water among the stones,neg
Are nine-and-fifty swans.,neg
The nineteenth autumn has come upon me,neg
Since I first made my count;,neg
"I saw, before I had well finished,",neg
All suddenly mount,neg
And scatter wheeling in great broken rings,neg
Upon their clamorous wings.,neg
"I have looked upon those brilliant creatures,",neg
And now my heart is sore.,neg
"All's changed since I, hearing at twilight,",neg
"The first time on this shore,",neg
"The bell-beat of their wings above my head,",neg
Trod with a lighter tread.,neg
"Unwearied still, lover by lover,",neg
They paddle in the cold,neg
Companionable streams or climb the air;,neg
Their hearts have not grown old;,neg
"Passion or conquest, wander where they will,",neg
Attend upon them still.,neg
"But now they drift on the still water,",neg
"Mysterious, beautiful;",neg
"Among what rushes will they build,",neg
By what lake's edge or pool,neg
Delight men's eyes when I awake some day,neg
"To find they have flown away?Give me hunger,",neg
O you gods that sit and give,neg
The world its orders.,neg
"Give me hunger, pain and want,",neg
Shut me out with shame and failure,neg
"From your doors of gold and fame,",neg
"Give me your shabbiest, weariest hunger!",neg
"But leave me a little love,",neg
"A voice to speak to me in the day end,",neg
A hand to touch me in the dark room,neg
Breaking the long loneliness.,neg
In the dusk of day-shapes,neg
"Blurring the sunset,",neg
"One little wandering, western star",neg
Thrust out from the changing shores of shadow.,neg
"Let me go to the window,",neg
Watch there the day-shapes of dusk,neg
And wait and know the coming,neg
"Of a little love.Passing through huddled and ugly walls,",neg
By doorways where women haggard,neg
"Looked from their hunger-deep eyes,",neg
"Haunted with shadows of hunger-hands,",neg
"Out from the huddled and ugly walls,",neg
"I came sudden, at the city's edge,",neg
"On a blue burst of lake,",neg
Long lake waves breaking under the sun,neg
On a spray-flung curve of shore;,neg
"And a fluttering storm of gulls,",neg
Masses of great gray wings,neg
And flying white bellies,neg
Veering and wheeling free in the open.Desolate and lone,neg
All night long on the lake,neg
"Where fog trails and mist creeps,",neg
The whistle of a boat,neg
"Calls and cries unendingly,",neg
Like some lost child,neg
In tears and trouble,neg
Hunting the harbor's breast,neg
"And the harbor's eyes.Momus is the name men give your face,",neg
"The brag of its tone, like a long low steamboat whistle",neg
"Finding a way mid mist on a shoreland,",neg
"Where gray rocks let the salt water shatter spray Against horizons purple, silent.",neg
"Yes, Momus,",neg
Men have flung your face in bronze,neg
To gaze in gargoyle downward on a street-whirl of folk.,neg
"They were artists did this, shaped your sad mouth,",neg
"Gave you a tall forehead slanted with calm, broad wisdom;",neg
All your lips to the corners and your cheeks to the high bones,neg
"Thrown over and through with a smile that forever wishes and wishes, purple, silent, fled from all the iron things of life, evaded like a sought bandit, gone into dreams, by God.",neg
"I wonder, Momus,",neg
Whether shadows of the dead sit somewhere and look with deep laughter,neg
"On men who play in terrible earnest the old, known, solemn repetitions of history.",neg
"A droning monotone soft as sea laughter hovers from your kindliness of bronze,",neg
"You give me the human ease of a mountain peak, purple, silent;",neg
"Granite shoulders heaving above the earth curves,",neg
Careless eye-witness of the spawning tides of men and women,neg
"Swarming always in a drift of millions to the dust of toil, the salt of tears,",neg
And blood drops of undiminishing war.I shall foot it,neg
"Down the roadway in the dusk,",neg
Where shapes of hunger wander,neg
And the fugitives of pain go by.,neg
I shall foot it,neg
"In the silence of the morning,",neg
"See the night slur into dawn,",neg
Hear the slow great winds arise,neg
Where tall trees flank the way,neg
And shoulder toward the sky.,neg
The broken boulders by the road,neg
Shall not commemorate my ruin.,neg
Regret shall be the gravel under foot.,neg
I shall watch for,neg
Slim birds swift of wing,neg
That go where wind and ranks of thunder,neg
Drive the wild processionals of rain.,neg
The dust of the travelled road,neg
"Shall touch my hands and face.I have sat here happy in the gardens,",neg
Watching the still pool and the reeds,neg
And the dark clouds,neg
Which the wind of the upper air,neg
Tore like the green leafy boughs,neg
Of the divers-hued trees of late summer;,neg
But though I greatly delight,neg
"In these and the water-lilies,",neg
That which sets me nighest to weeping,neg
"Is the rose and white color of the smooth flag-stones,",neg
And the pale yellow grasses,neg
"Among them.Potuia, potuia",neg
"White grave goddess,",neg
"Pity my sadness,",neg
O silence of Paros.,neg
"I am not of these about thy feet,",neg
These garments and decorum;,neg
"I am thy brother,",neg
"Thy lover of aforetime crying to thee,",neg
And thou hearest me not.,neg
I have whispered thee in thy solitudes,neg
"Of our loves in Phrygia,",neg
The far ecstasy of burning noons,neg
When the fragile pipes,neg
"Ceased in the cypress shade,",neg
And the brown fingers of the shepherd,neg
Moved over slim shoulders;,neg
And only the cicada sang.,neg
I have told thee of the hills,neg
And the lisp of reeds,neg
"And the sun upon thy breasts,",neg
"And thou hearest me not,",neg
"Potuia, potuia",neg
Thou hearest me not.The ancient songs,neg
Pass deathward mournfully.,neg
"Cold lips that sing no more, and withered wreaths,",neg
"Regretful eyes, and drooping breasts and wings",neg
Symbols of ancient songs,neg
Mournfully passing,neg
"Down to the great white surges,",neg
Watched of none         - -,neg
Save the frail sea-birds,neg
"And the lithe pale girls,",neg
Daughters of Okeanos.,neg
And the songs pass,neg
From the green land,neg
Which lies upon the waves as a leaf,neg
On the flowers of hyacinth;,neg
"And they pass from the waters,",neg
"The manifold winds and the dim moon,",neg
"And they come,",neg
"Silently winging through soft Kimmerian dusk,",neg
To the quiet level lands,neg
"That she keeps for us all,",neg
That she wrought for us all for sleep,neg
In the silver days of the earth's dawning,neg
"Proserpine, daughter of Zeus.",neg
"And we turn from the Kuprian's breasts,",neg
"And we turn from thee,",neg
"Phoibos Apollon,",neg
And we turn from the music of old,neg
"And the hills that we loved and the meads,",neg
"And we turn from the fiery day,",neg
And the lips that were over-sweet;,neg
For silently,neg
"Brushing the fields with red-shod feet,",neg
With purple robe,neg
"Searing the flowers as with a sudden flame,",neg
"Death,",neg
Thou hast come upon us.,neg
And of all the ancient songs,neg
Passing to the swallow-blue halls,neg
"By the dark streams of Persephone,",neg
This only remains:,neg
"That in the end we turn to thee,",neg
"Death,",neg
"That we turn to thee, singing",neg
One last song.,neg
"O Death,",neg
Thou art an healing wind,neg
That blowest over white flowers,neg
A-tremble with dew;,neg
Thou art a wind flowing,neg
Over long leagues of lonely sea;,neg
Thou art the dusk and the fragrance;,neg
Thou art the lips of love mournfully smiling;,neg
Thou art the pale peace of one,neg
Satiate with old desires;,neg
"Thou art the silence of beauty,",neg
And we look no more for the morning;,neg
"We yearn no more for the sun,",neg
"Since with thy white hands,",neg
"Death,",neg
"Thou crownest us with the pallid chaplets,",neg
The slim colorless poppies,neg
Which in thy garden alone,neg
Softly thou gatherest.,neg
And silently;,neg
And with slow feet approaching;,neg
"And with bowed head and unlit eyes,",neg
We kneel before thee:,neg
"And thou, leaning towards us, Caressingly layest upon us",neg
"Flowers from thy thin cold hands,",neg
"And, smiling as a chaste woman Knowing love in her heart,",neg
Thou sealest our eyes,neg
And the illimitable quietude,neg
Comes gently upon us.,neg
"Why didst thou promise such a beauteous day,",renaissance_love
"And make me travel forth without my cloak,",renaissance_love
"To let base clouds oertake me in my way,",renaissance_love
Hiding thy bravery in their rotten smoke?,renaissance_love
"Tis not enough that through the cloud thou break,",renaissance_love
"To dry the rain on my storm-beaten face,",renaissance_love
For no man well of such a salve can speak,renaissance_love
That heals the wound and cures not the disgrace:,renaissance_love
Nor can thy shame give physic to my grief;,renaissance_love
"Though thou repent, yet I have still the loss:",renaissance_love
The offenders sorrow lends but weak relief,renaissance_love
To him that bears the strong offences cross.,renaissance_love
"Ah! but those tears are pearl which thy love sheds,",renaissance_love
And they are rich and ransom all ill deeds.,renaissance_love
"Weret aught to me I bore the canopy,",renaissance_love
"With my extern the outward honouring,",renaissance_love
"Or laid great bases for eternity,",renaissance_love
Which proves more short than waste or ruining;,renaissance_love
Have I not seen dwellers on form and favour,renaissance_love
"Lose all, and more, by paying too much rent,",renaissance_love
"For compound sweet forgoing simple savour,",renaissance_love
"Pitiful thrivers, in their gazing spent?",renaissance_love
"No;let me be obsequious in thy heart,",renaissance_love
"And take thou my oblation, poor but free,",renaissance_love
"Which is not mixd with seconds, knows no art,",renaissance_love
"But mutual render, only me for thee.",renaissance_love
"Hence, thou subornd informer! a true soul,",renaissance_love
"When most impeachd, stands least in thy control. ",renaissance_love
Let the bird of loudest lay,renaissance_love
On the sole Arabian tree,renaissance_love
"Herald sad and trumpet be,",renaissance_love
To whose sound chaste wings obey.,renaissance_love
"But thou shrieking harbinger,",renaissance_love
"Foul precurrer of the fiend,",renaissance_love
"Augur of the fever's end,",renaissance_love
To this troop come thou not near.,renaissance_love
From this session interdict,renaissance_love
"Every fowl of tyrant wing,",renaissance_love
"Save the eagle, feather'd king;",renaissance_love
Keep the obsequy so strict.,renaissance_love
"Let the priest in surplice white,",renaissance_love
"That defunctive music can,",renaissance_love
"Be the death-divining swan,",renaissance_love
Lest the requiem lack his right.,renaissance_love
"And thou treble-dated crow,",renaissance_love
That thy sable gender mak'st,renaissance_love
"With the breath thou giv'st and tak'st,",renaissance_love
'Mongst our mourners shalt thou go.,renaissance_love
Here the anthem doth commence:,renaissance_love
Love and constancy is dead;,renaissance_love
Phoenix and the Turtle fled,renaissance_love
In a mutual flame from hence.,renaissance_love
"So they lov'd, as love in twain",renaissance_love
Had the essence but in one;,renaissance_love
"Two distincts, division none:",renaissance_love
Number there in love was slain.,renaissance_love
"Hearts remote, yet not asunder;",renaissance_love
Distance and no space was seen,renaissance_love
'Twixt this Turtle and his queen:,renaissance_love
But in them it were a wonder.,renaissance_love
So between them love did shine,renaissance_love
That the Turtle saw his right,renaissance_love
Flaming in the Phoenix' sight:,renaissance_love
Either was the other's mine.,renaissance_love
Property was thus appalled,renaissance_love
That the self was not the same;,renaissance_love
Single nature's double name,renaissance_love
Neither two nor one was called.,renaissance_love
"Reason, in itself confounded,",renaissance_love
"Saw division grow together,",renaissance_love
"To themselves yet either neither,",renaissance_love
Simple were so well compounded;,renaissance_love
"That it cried, How true a twain",renaissance_love
Seemeth this concordant one!,renaissance_love
"Love has reason, reason none,",renaissance_love
If what parts can so remain.,renaissance_love
Whereupon it made this threne,renaissance_love
"To the Phoenix and the Dove,",renaissance_love
"Co-supremes and stars of love,",renaissance_love
As chorus to their tragic scene:,renaissance_love
"Beauty, truth, and rarity,",renaissance_love
"Grace in all simplicity,",renaissance_love
"Here enclos'd, in cinders lie.",renaissance_love
"Death is now the Phoenix' nest,",renaissance_love
And the Turtle's loyal breast,renaissance_love
"To eternity doth rest,",renaissance_love
Leaving no posterity:,renaissance_love
"'Twas not their infirmity,",renaissance_love
It was married chastity.,renaissance_love
Truth may seem but cannot be;,renaissance_love
Beauty brag but 'tis not she;,renaissance_love
Truth and beauty buried be.,renaissance_love
To this urn let those repair,renaissance_love
That are either true or fair;,renaissance_love
For these dead birds sigh a prayer.,renaissance_love
"Sing lullaby, as women do,",renaissance_love
"Wherewith they bring their babes to rest,",renaissance_love
And lullaby can I sing too,renaissance_love
As womanly as can the best.,renaissance_love
"With lullaby they still the child,",renaissance_love
"And if I be not much beguiled,",renaissance_love
Full many wanton babes have I,renaissance_love
Which must be stilled with lullaby.,renaissance_love
First lullaby my youthful years;,renaissance_love
"It is now time to go to bed,",renaissance_love
For crooked age and hoary hairs,renaissance_love
Have won the haven within my head.,renaissance_love
"With lullaby, then, youth be still;",renaissance_love
With lullaby content thy will;,renaissance_love
"Since courage quails and comes behind,",renaissance_love
"Go sleep, and so beguile thy mind.",renaissance_love
"Next, lullaby my gazing eyes,",renaissance_love
Which wonted were to glance apace.,renaissance_love
For every glass may now suffice,renaissance_love
To show the furrows in my face;,renaissance_love
"With lullaby then wink awhile,",renaissance_love
With lullaby your looks beguile;,renaissance_love
Let no fair face nor beauty bright,renaissance_love
Entice you eft with vain delight.,renaissance_love
"And lullaby, my wanton will;",renaissance_love
"Let reason's rule now reign thy thought,",renaissance_love
Since all too late I find by skill,renaissance_love
How dear I have thy fancies bought;,renaissance_love
"With lullaby now take thine ease,",renaissance_love
With lullaby thy doubts appease.,renaissance_love
"For trust to this: if thou be still,",renaissance_love
My body shall obey thy will.,renaissance_love
"Eke lullaby, my loving boy,",renaissance_love
"My little Robin, take thy rest;",renaissance_love
"Since age is cold and nothing coy,",renaissance_love
"Keep close thy coin, for so is best;",renaissance_love
"With lullaby be thou content,",renaissance_love
"With lullaby thy lusts relent,",renaissance_love
Let others pay which hath mo pence;,renaissance_love
Thou art too poor for such expense.,renaissance_love
"Thus lullaby, my youth, mine eyes,",renaissance_love
"My will, my ware, and all that was.",renaissance_love
"I can no mo delays devise,",renaissance_love
"But welcome pain, let pleasure pass;",renaissance_love
"With lullaby now take your leave,",renaissance_love
With lullaby your dreams deceive;,renaissance_love
"And when you rise with waking eye,",renaissance_love
Remember then this lullaby.,renaissance_love
Beshrew that heart that makes my heart to groan,renaissance_love
For that deep wound it gives my friend and me:,renaissance_love
"Ist not enough to torture me alone,",renaissance_love
But slave to slavery my sweetst friend must be?,renaissance_love
"Me from myself thy cruel eye hath taken,",renaissance_love
And my next self thou harder hast engrossed;,renaissance_love
"Of him, myself, and thee I am forsaken,",renaissance_love
A torment thrice threefold thus to be crossed.,renaissance_love
"Prison my heart in thy steel bosom's ward,",renaissance_love
But then my friend's heart let my poor heart bail;,renaissance_love
"Whoeer keeps me, let my heart be his guard:",renaissance_love
Thou canst not then use rigour in my jail.,renaissance_love
"And yet thou wilt; for I, being pent in thee,",renaissance_love
"Perforce am thine, and all that is in me.",renaissance_love
"O, call not me to justify the wrong",renaissance_love
That thy unkindness lays upon my heart;,renaissance_love
Wound me not with thine eye but with thy tongue;,renaissance_love
"Use power with power, and slay me not by art.",renaissance_love
"Tell me thou lovst elsewhere; but in my sight,",renaissance_love
"Dear heart, forbear to glance thine eye aside;",renaissance_love
What needst thou wound with cunning when thy might,renaissance_love
Is more than my oerpressed defense can bide?,renaissance_love
"Let me excuse thee: ah, my love well knows",renaissance_love
Her pretty looks have been mine enemies;,renaissance_love
"And therefore from my face she turns my foes,",renaissance_love
That they elsewhere might dart their injuries,renaissance_love
"Yet do not so; but since I am near slain,",renaissance_love
Kill me outright with looks and rid my pain.,renaissance_love
"Love is my sin, and thy dear virtue hate,",renaissance_love
"Hate of my sin, grounded on sinful loving.",renaissance_love
"O, but with mine compare thou thine own state,",renaissance_love
And thou shalt find it merits not reproving;,renaissance_love
"Or if it do, not from those lips of thine,",renaissance_love
That have profaned their scarlet ornaments,renaissance_love
"And sealed false bonds of love as oft as mine,",renaissance_love
Robbed others beds revenues of their rents.,renaissance_love
Be it lawful I love thee as thou lovst those,renaissance_love
Whom thine eyes woo as mine importune thee:,renaissance_love
"Root pity in thy heart, that, when it grows,",renaissance_love
Thy pity may deserve to pitied be.,renaissance_love
"If thou dost seek to have what thou dost hide,",renaissance_love
By self-example mayst thou be denied.,renaissance_love
"My love is as a fever, longing still",renaissance_love
"For that which longer nurseth the disease,",renaissance_love
"Feeding on that which doth preserve the ill,",renaissance_love
Th uncertain sickly appetite to please.,renaissance_love
"My reason, the physician to my love,",renaissance_love
"Angry that his prescriptions are not kept,",renaissance_love
"Hath left me, and I desperate now approve",renaissance_love
"Desire is death, which physic did except.",renaissance_love
"Past cure I am, now reason is past care,",renaissance_love
And frantic-mad with evermore unrest;,renaissance_love
"My thoughts and my discourse as madmens are,",renaissance_love
At random from the truth vainly expressed:,renaissance_love
"For I have sworn thee fair, and thought thee bright,",renaissance_love
"Who art as black as hell, as dark as night.",renaissance_love
"A Poet am I neither born nor bred,",renaissance_love
But to a witty poet married:,renaissance_love
"Whose brain is fresh and pleasant as the Spring,",renaissance_love
Where Fancies grow and where the Muses sing.,renaissance_love
"There oft I lean my head, and listening, hark,",renaissance_love
To catch his words and all his fancies mark:,renaissance_love
And from that garden show of beauties take,renaissance_love
Whereof a posy I in verse may make.,renaissance_love
"Thus I, that have no gardens of my own,",renaissance_love
There gather flowers that are newly blown.,renaissance_love
"Loving in truth, and fain in verse my love to show,",renaissance_love
"That she, dear she, might take some pleasure of my pain,",renaissance_love
"Pleasure might cause her read, reading might make her know,",renaissance_love

Whereto I thus replied:,renaissance_love
Each fisherman can wish,renaissance_love

And so did I (in vain),renaissance_love

There ere by them aught undertaken be,renaissance_love
They first resort unto that sovereign part;,renaissance_love
"Sweet, for a while give respite to my heart,",renaissance_love
"Which pants as though it still should leap to thee,",renaissance_love
And on my thoughts give thy lieutenancy,renaissance_love
"To this great cause, which needs both use and art,",renaissance_love
"And as a queen, who from her presence sends",renaissance_love

Upon whose breast a fiercer gripe doth tire,renaissance_love
"Than did on him who first stale down the fire,",renaissance_love

"If that be sin which doth the manners frame,",renaissance_love
"Well stayed with truth in word and faith of deed,",renaissance_love
"Ready of wit, and fearing naught but shame;",renaissance_love
If that be sin which in fixed hearts doth breed,renaissance_love
"A loathing of all loose unchastity,",renaissance_love
"Then love is sin, and let me sinful be.",renaissance_love
"Not at first sight, nor with a dribbed shot,",renaissance_love
   Love gave the wound which while I breathe will bleed:,renaissance_love
"   But known worth did in mine of time proceed,",renaissance_love
Till by degrees it had full conquest got.,renaissance_love
"I saw, and liked; I liked, but loved not;",renaissance_love
"   I loved, but straight did not what love decreed:",renaissance_love
"   At length to loves decrees I, forced, agreed,",renaissance_love
Yet with repining at so partial lot.,renaissance_love
   Now even that footstep of lost liberty,renaissance_love
"Is gone, and now like slave-born Muscovite",renaissance_love
I call it praise to suffer tyranny;,renaissance_love
And now employ the remnant of my wit,renaissance_love
"   To make myself believe that all is well,",renaissance_love
   While with a feeling skill I paint my hell.,renaissance_love
   Your words my friend (right healthful caustics) blame,renaissance_love

"By Phoebus doom, with sugared sentence says",renaissance_love
"That Virtue, if it once met with our eyes,",renaissance_love
Strange flames of love it in our souls would raise;,renaissance_love
"But, for that man with pain this truth descries,",renaissance_love

"Virtue of late, with virtuous care to stir",renaissance_love
"Love of herself, takes Stellas shape, that she",renaissance_love
To mortal eyes might sweetly shine in her.,renaissance_love

What! may it be that even in heavenly place,renaissance_love
That busy archer his sharp arrows tries?,renaissance_love
"Sure, if that long-with-love-acquainted eyes",renaissance_love
"Can judge of love, thou feelst a lovers case:",renaissance_love
I read it in thy looks; thy languished grace,renaissance_love
"To me, that feel the like, thy state descries.",renaissance_love
"Then, even of fellowship, O Moon, tell me,",renaissance_love
Is constant love deemed there but want of wit?,renaissance_love
Are beauties there as proud as here they be?,renaissance_love
"Do they above love to be loved, and yet",renaissance_love
    Those lovers scorn whom that love doth possess?,renaissance_love
    Do they call virtue thereungratefulness?,renaissance_love
"    What, have I thus betrayed my liberty?",renaissance_love
Can those black beams such burning marks engrave,renaissance_love
"In my free side? or am I born a slave,",renaissance_love
Whose neck becomes such yoke of tyranny?,renaissance_love
Or want I sense to feel my misery?,renaissance_love
"Or sprite, disdain of such disdain to have?",renaissance_love
"Who for long faith, though daily help I crave,",renaissance_love
May get no alms but scorn of beggary.,renaissance_love

Co-partner of the riches of that sight;,renaissance_love
Let not mine eyes be hell-drivn from that light;,renaissance_love

A kind of grace it is to slay with speed.,renaissance_love

"Our horsemanships, while by strange work I prove",renaissance_love
"A horseman to my horse, a horse to Love,",renaissance_love

"Of hope, which makes it seem fair to the eye.",renaissance_love
"The wand is will; thou, fancy, saddle art,",renaissance_love
Girt fast by memory; and while I spur,renaissance_love

And now hath made me to his hand so right,renaissance_love
That in the manage myself takes delight.,renaissance_love

While each pretends that Stella must be his:,renaissance_love
"Her eyes, her lips, her all, saith Love, do this,",renaissance_love

That Stella (O dear name) that Stella is,renaissance_love
"That virtuous soul, sure heir of heavnly bliss;",renaissance_love
"Not this fair outside, which our hearts doth move.",renaissance_love

"   but will, or ere I go,",renaissance_love
"In perfect love and charity,",renaissance_love
"   my testament here write,",renaissance_love
"And leave to thee such treasury,",renaissance_love
   as I in it recite.,renaissance_love
Now stand aside and give me leave,renaissance_love
      to write my latest will;,renaissance_love
And see that none you do deceive,renaissance_love
   of that I leave them till.,renaissance_love
"   O happy dames, that may embrace",renaissance_love
"The fruit of your delight,",renaissance_love
Help to bewail the woeful case,renaissance_love
And eke the heavy plight,renaissance_love
"Of me, that wonted to rejoice",renaissance_love
The fortune of my pleasant choice;,renaissance_love
"Good ladies, help to fill my mourning voice.",renaissance_love
"In ship, freight with remembrance",renaissance_love
"Of thoughts and pleasures past,",renaissance_love
He sails that hath in governance,renaissance_love
My life while it will last;,renaissance_love
"With scalding sighs, for lack of gale,",renaissance_love
"Furthering his hope, that is his sail,",renaissance_love
"Toward me, the sweet port of his avail.",renaissance_love
Alas! how oft in dreams I see,renaissance_love
Those eyes that were my food;,renaissance_love
"Which sometime so delighted me,",renaissance_love
That yet they do me good;,renaissance_love
"Wherewith I wake with his return,",renaissance_love
Whose absent flame did make me burn:,renaissance_love
"But when I find the lack, Lord, how I mourn!",renaissance_love
When other lovers in arms across,renaissance_love
Rejoice their chief delight.,renaissance_love
"Drowned in tears, to mourn my loss",renaissance_love
I stand the bitter night,renaissance_love
"In my window, where I may see",renaissance_love
Before the winds how the clouds flee.,renaissance_love
Lo! what a mariner love hath made of me!,renaissance_love
And in green waves when the salt flood,renaissance_love
"Doth rise by rage of wind,",renaissance_love
A thousand fancies in that mood,renaissance_love
Assail my restless mind.,renaissance_love
"Alas! now drencheth my sweet foe,",renaissance_love
"That with the spoil of my heart did go,",renaissance_love
"And left me; but, alas! why did he so?",renaissance_love
And when the seas wax calm again,renaissance_love
"To chase fro me annoy,",renaissance_love
My doubtful hope doth cause me pain;,renaissance_love
So dread cuts off my joy.,renaissance_love
"Thus is my wealth mingled with woe,",renaissance_love
And of each thought a doubt doth grow;,renaissance_love
"Now he comes! Will he come? Alas, no, no!",renaissance_love
 Unto the boundless Ocean of thy beauty,renaissance_love
"Runs this poor river, charged with streams of zeal:",renaissance_love
"Returning thee the tribute of my duty,",renaissance_love
"Which here my love, my youth, my plaints reveal.",renaissance_love
"Here I unclasp the book of my charged soul,",renaissance_love
Where I have cast th'accounts of all my care:,renaissance_love
"Here have I summed my sighs, here I enroll",renaissance_love
How they were spent for thee; look what they are.,renaissance_love
"Look on the dear expenses of my youth,",renaissance_love
And see how just I reckon with thine eyes:,renaissance_love
"Examine well thy beauty with my truth,",renaissance_love
And cross my cares ere greater sum arise.,renaissance_love
"Read it sweet maid, though it be done but slightly;",renaissance_love

"Go wailing verse, the infants of my love,",renaissance_love
"Minerva-like, brought forth without a Mother:",renaissance_love
"Present the image of the cares I prove,",renaissance_love
Witness your Fathers grief exceeds all other.,renaissance_love
"Sigh out a story of her cruel deeds,",renaissance_love
With interrupted accents of despair:,renaissance_love
"A monument that whosoever reads,",renaissance_love
"May justly praise, and blame my loveless Fair.",renaissance_love
"Say her disdain hath dried up my blood,",renaissance_love
"And starved you, in succours still denying:",renaissance_love
"Press to her eyes, importune me some good;",renaissance_love
Waken her sleeping pity with your crying.,renaissance_love
"Knock at that hard heart, beg till you have moved her;",renaissance_love
"And tell thunkind, how dearly I have loved her.",renaissance_love
"But love whilst that thou mayst be loved again,",renaissance_love
"Now whilst thy May hath filed thy lap with flowers,",renaissance_love
"Now whilst thy beauty bears without a stain,",renaissance_love
"Now use the summer smiles, ere winter lowers.",renaissance_love
And whilst thou spreadst unto the rising sun,renaissance_love
"The fairest flower that ever saw the light,",renaissance_love
"Now joy thy time before thy sweet be done,",renaissance_love
"And, Delia, think thy morning must have night,",renaissance_love
"And that thy brightness sets at length to west,",renaissance_love
When thou wilt close up that which now thou shewst;,renaissance_love
And think the same becomes they fading best,renaissance_love
Which then shall most inveil and shadow most.,renaissance_love
"Men do not weigh the stalk for what it was,",renaissance_love
"When once they find her flower, her glory, pass.",renaissance_love
"But love whilst that thou mayst be loved again,",renaissance_love
"Now whilst thy May hath filled thy lap with flowers,",renaissance_love
"Now whilst thy beauty bears without a stain,",renaissance_love

"Men do not weigh the stalk for what it was,",renaissance_love
"When once they find her flower, her glory, pass.",renaissance_love
"When men shall find thy flower, thy glory pass,",renaissance_love
"And thou, with careful brow sitting alone,",renaissance_love
"Received hast this message from thy glass,",renaissance_love
"That tells thee truth, and says that all is gone,",renaissance_love
"Fresh shalt thou see in me the wounds thou madest,",renaissance_love
"Though spent thy flame, in me the heat remaining,",renaissance_love
"I that have loved thee thus before thou fadest,",renaissance_love
"My faith shall wax, when thou art in thy waning.",renaissance_love
"The world shall find this miracle in me,",renaissance_love
That fire can burn when all the matters spent;,renaissance_love
"Then what my faith hath been thyself shall see,",renaissance_love
And that thou wast unkind thou mayst repent.,renaissance_love
"Thou mayst repent that thou hast scorned my tears,",renaissance_love
When Winter snows upon thy golden hairs.,renaissance_love
"Unhappy pen and ill accepted papers,",renaissance_love
"That intimate in vain my chaste desires,",renaissance_love
"My chaste desires, the ever burning tapers,",renaissance_love
Enkindled by her eyes celestial fires.,renaissance_love
"Celestial fires and unrespecting powers,",renaissance_love
"That deign not view the glory of your might,",renaissance_love
"In humble lines the work of careful hours,",renaissance_love
The sacrifice I offer to her sight.,renaissance_love
"But since she scorns her own, this rests for me,",renaissance_love
"Ill moan my self, and hide the wrong I have:",renaissance_love
And so content me that her frowns should be,renaissance_love
"To my infant style the cradle, and the grave.",renaissance_love
"What though my self no honor get thereby,",renaissance_love
"Each bird sings therself, and so will I.",renaissance_love
A face that should content me wondrous well,renaissance_love
"Should not be fair but lovely to behold,",renaissance_love
With gladsome cheer all grief for to expel;,renaissance_love
With sober looks so would I that it should,renaissance_love
Speak without words such words as none can tell;,renaissance_love
Her tress also should be of crisped gold;,renaissance_love
"With wit; and thus might chance I might be tied,",renaissance_love
And knit again the knot that should not slide.,renaissance_love
In summers heat and mid-time of the day,renaissance_love
"To rest my limbs upon a bed I lay,",renaissance_love
"One window shut, the other open stood,",renaissance_love
"Which gave such light as twinkles in a wood,",renaissance_love
Like twilight glimpse at setting of the sun,renaissance_love
"Or night being past, and yet not day begun.",renaissance_love
"Such light to shamefaced maidens must be shown,",renaissance_love
"Where they may sport, and seem to be unknown.",renaissance_love
"Then came Corinna in a long loose gown,",renaissance_love
Her white neck hid with tresses hanging down:,renaissance_love
Resembling fair Semiramis going to bed,renaissance_love
Or Lais of a thousand wooers sped.,renaissance_love
"I snatched her gown, being thin, the harm was small,",renaissance_love
Yet strived she to be covered therewithal.,renaissance_love
"And striving thus as one that would be cast,",renaissance_love
"Betrayed herself, and yielded at the last.",renaissance_love
"Stark naked as she stood before mine eye,",renaissance_love
Not one wen in her body could I spy.,renaissance_love
"What arms and shoulders did I touch and see,",renaissance_love
How apt her breasts were to be pressed by me?,renaissance_love
How smooth a belly under her waist saw I?,renaissance_love
"How large a leg, and what a lusty thigh?",renaissance_love
"To leave the rest, all liked me passing well,",renaissance_love
"I clinged her naked body, down she fell,",renaissance_love
"Judge you the rest: being tired she bad me kiss,",renaissance_love
Jove send me more such afternoons as this.,renaissance_love
"So, so breake off this last lamenting kisse,",renaissance_love
"    Which sucks two soules, and vapours Both away,",renaissance_love
"Turne thou ghost that way, and let mee turne this,",renaissance_love
"    And let our selves benight our happiest day,",renaissance_love
We askd none leave to love; nor will we owe,renaissance_love
"    Any, so cheape a death, as saying, Goe;",renaissance_love
"Goe; and if that word have not quite kild thee,",renaissance_love
"    Ease mee with death, by bidding mee goe too.",renaissance_love
"Oh, if it have, let my word worke on mee,",renaissance_love
    And a just office on a murderer doe.,renaissance_love
"Except it be too late, to kill me so,",renaissance_love
"    Being double dead, going, and bidding, goe.",renaissance_love
"    Farewell, false love, the oracle of lies,",renaissance_love
"A mortal foe and enemy to rest,",renaissance_love
"An envious boy, from whom all cares arise,",renaissance_love
"A bastard vile, a beast with rage possessed,",renaissance_love
"A way of error, a temple full of treason,",renaissance_love
In all effects contrary unto reason.,renaissance_love
"A poisoned serpent covered all with flowers,",renaissance_love
"Mother of sighs, and murderer of repose,",renaissance_love
A sea of sorrows whence are drawn such showers,renaissance_love
As moisture lend to every grief that grows;,renaissance_love
"A school of guile, a net of deep deceit,",renaissance_love
A gilded hook that holds a poisoned bait.,renaissance_love
"A fortress foiled, which reason did defend,",renaissance_love
"A siren song, a fever of the mind,",renaissance_love
"A maze wherein affection finds no end,",renaissance_love
"A raging cloud that runs before the wind,",renaissance_love
"A substance like the shadow of the sun,",renaissance_love
A goal of grief for which the wisest run.,renaissance_love
"A quenchless fire, a nurse of trembling fear,",renaissance_love
"A path that leads to peril and mishap,",renaissance_love
"A true retreat of sorrow and despair,",renaissance_love
"An idle boy that sleeps in pleasure's lap,",renaissance_love
"A deep mistrust of that which certain seems,",renaissance_love
A hope of that which reason doubtful deems.,renaissance_love
"Sith then thy trains my younger years betrayed,",renaissance_love
And for my faith ingratitude I find;,renaissance_love
"And sith repentance hath my wrongs bewrayed,",renaissance_love
Whose course was ever contrary to kind:,renaissance_love
"False love, desire, and beauty frail, adieu!",renaissance_love
Dead is the root whence all these fancies grew.,renaissance_love
"Mark but this flea, and mark in this,   ",renaissance_love
How little that which thou deniest me is;   ,renaissance_love
"It sucked me first, and now sucks thee,",renaissance_love
And in this flea our two bloods mingled be;   ,renaissance_love
Thou knowst that this cannot be said,renaissance_love
"A sin, nor shame, nor loss of maidenhead,",renaissance_love
"    Yet this enjoys before it woo,",renaissance_love
"    And pampered swells with one blood made of two,",renaissance_love
"    And this, alas, is more than we would do.",renaissance_love
"Oh stay, three lives in one flea spare,",renaissance_love
"Where we almost, nay more than married are.   ",renaissance_love
"This flea is you and I, and this",renaissance_love
"Our mariage bed, and marriage temple is;   ",renaissance_love
"Though parents grudge, and you, w'are met,   ",renaissance_love
And cloistered in these living walls of jet.,renaissance_love
"    Though use make you apt to kill me,",renaissance_love
"    Let not to that, self-murder added be,",renaissance_love
"    And sacrilege, three sins in killing three.",renaissance_love
"Cruel and sudden, hast thou since",renaissance_love
"Purpled thy nail, in blood of innocence?   ",renaissance_love
"Wherein could this flea guilty be,",renaissance_love
Except in that drop which it sucked from thee?   ,renaissance_love
"Yet thou triumphst, and say'st that thou   ",renaissance_love
"Findst not thy self, nor me the weaker now;",renaissance_love
"    Tis true; then learn how false, fears be:",renaissance_love
"    Just so much honor, when thou yieldst to me,",renaissance_love
"    Will waste, as this fleas death took life from thee.",renaissance_love
"    You must not wonder, though you think it strange,",renaissance_love
"To see me hold my louring head so low,",renaissance_love
And that mine eyes take no delight to range,renaissance_love
About the gleams which on your face do grow.,renaissance_love
The mouse which once hath broken out of trap,renaissance_love
"Is seldom ticed with the trustless bait,",renaissance_love
"But lies aloof for fear of more mishap,",renaissance_love
And feedeth still in doubt of deep deceit.,renaissance_love
"The scorched fly, which once hath scaped the flame,",renaissance_love
"Will hardly come to play again with fire,",renaissance_love
Whereby I learn that grievous is the game,renaissance_love
Which follows fancy dazzled by desire:,renaissance_love

Because your blazing eyes my bale have bred.,renaissance_love

"Fortune hath taken all away from me,",renaissance_love
Fortune hath taken all by taking thee.,renaissance_love
"Dead to all joy, I only live to woe,",renaissance_love
So fortune now becomes my mortal foe.,renaissance_love
"In vain you eyes, you eyes do waste your tears,",renaissance_love
"In vain you sighs do smoke forth my despairs,",renaissance_love
"In vain you search the earth and heaven above,",renaissance_love

"Thus now I leave my love in fortunes hands,",renaissance_love
"Thus now I leave my love in fortunes bands,",renaissance_love
And only love the sorrows due to me;,renaissance_love
Sorrow henceforth it shall my princess be.,renaissance_love
"I joy in this, that fortune conquers kings;",renaissance_love
Fortune that rules on earth and earthly things,renaissance_love
Hath taken my love in spite of Cupids might;,renaissance_love
So blind a dame did never Cupid right.,renaissance_love
"With wisdoms eyes had but blind Cupid seen,",renaissance_love
Then had my love my love for ever been;,renaissance_love
"But love farewell; though fortune conquer thee,",renaissance_love
No fortune base shall ever alter me.,renaissance_love

Fit to hear and ease my care;,renaissance_love

Sweet reward for sharpest pain;,renaissance_love

Cursed by my destines all,renaissance_love
That brought me so high to fall:,renaissance_love
Soon with my death I will please thee.,renaissance_love

The reason no man knows; let it suffice,renaissance_love
What we behold is censured by our eyes.,renaissance_love
"Where both deliberate, the love is slight:",renaissance_love
"Who ever loved, that loved not at first sight?",renaissance_love
"I care not for these ladies,",renaissance_love
That must be wooed and prayed:,renaissance_love
"Give me kind Amaryllis,",renaissance_love
The wanton country maid.,renaissance_love
"Nature art disdaineth,",renaissance_love

She never will say no.,renaissance_love
If love now reigned as it hath been,renaissance_love
"And were rewarded as it hath sin,",renaissance_love
Noble men then would sure ensearch,renaissance_love
"All ways whereby they might it reach,",renaissance_love
But envy reigneth with such disdain,renaissance_love
"And causeth lovers outwardly to refrain,",renaissance_love
Which puts them to more and more,renaissance_love
Inwardly most grievous and sore.,renaissance_love
"The fault in whom I cannot set,",renaissance_love
But let them tell which love doth get,renaissance_love
To lovers I put now sure this case:,renaissance_love
Which of their loves doth get them grace?,renaissance_love

Converting all your sounds of woe,renaissance_love

"    Come, my Celia, let us prove,",renaissance_love
"While we can, the sports of love;",renaissance_love
Time will not be ours forever;,renaissance_love
He at length our good will sever.,renaissance_love
Spend not then his gifts in vain.,renaissance_love
Suns that set may rise again;,renaissance_love
"But if once we lose this light,",renaissance_love
Tis with us perpetual night.,renaissance_love
Why should we defer our joys?,renaissance_love
Fame and rumor are but toys.,renaissance_love
Cannot we delude the eyes,renaissance_love
"Of a few poor household spies,",renaissance_love
"Or his easier ears beguile,",renaissance_love
So removed by our wile?,renaissance_love
Tis no sin loves fruit to steal;,renaissance_love
"But the sweet thefts to reveal,",renaissance_love
"To be taken, to be seen,",renaissance_love
"These have crimes accounted been.Who is Silvia? what is she,",renaissance_love
    That all our swains commend her?,renaissance_love
"Holy, fair, and wise is she;",renaissance_love
"    The heaven such grace did lend her,",renaissance_love
That she might admired be.,renaissance_love
Is she kind as she is fair?,renaissance_love
    For beauty lives with kindness.,renaissance_love
"Love doth to her eyes repair,",renaissance_love
    To help him of his blindness;,renaissance_love
"And, being helped, inhabits there.",renaissance_love
"Then to Silvia let us sing,",renaissance_love
    That Silvia is excelling;,renaissance_love
She excels each mortal thing,renaissance_love
    Upon the dull earth dwelling;,renaissance_love
"To her let us garlands bringFrom fairest creatures we desire increase,",renaissance_love
"That thereby beautys rose might never die,",renaissance_love
"But as the riper should by time decease,",renaissance_love
His tender heir might bear his memory;,renaissance_love
"But thou, contracted to thine own bright eyes,",renaissance_love
"Feedst thy lights flame with self-substantial fuel,",renaissance_love
"Making a famine where abundance lies,",renaissance_love
"Thyself thy foe, to thy sweet self too cruel.",renaissance_love
Though that art now the worlds fresh ornament,renaissance_love
"And only herald to the gaudy spring,",renaissance_love
"Within thine own bud buriest thy content,",renaissance_love
"And, tender churl, makst waste in niggarding.",renaissance_love
"   Pity the world, or else this glutton be,",renaissance_love
"   To eat the worlds due, by the grave and thee.",renaissance_love
   When forty winters shall besiege thy brow,renaissance_love
"And dig deep trenches in thy beautys field,",renaissance_love
"Thy youths proud livery, so gazed on now,",renaissance_love
"Will be a tattered weed, of small worth held.",renaissance_love
Then being asked where all thy beauty lies,renaissance_love
Where all the treasure of thy lusty days,renaissance_love
To say within thine own deep-sunken eyes,renaissance_love
Were an all-eating shame and thriftless praise.,renaissance_love
How much more praise deserved thy beautys use ,renaissance_love
"If thou couldst answer ""This fair child of mine",renaissance_love
"Shall sum my count and make my old excuse"", ",renaissance_love
Proving his beauty by succession thine.,renaissance_love
"    This were to be new made when thou art old,",renaissance_love

"Now is the time that face should form another,",renaissance_love
"Whose fresh repair if now thou not renewest,",renaissance_love
"Thou dost beguile the world, unbless some mother.",renaissance_love
For where is she so fair whose uneared womb,renaissance_love
Disdains the tillage of thy husbandry?,renaissance_love
Or who is he so fond will be the tomb,renaissance_love
"Of his self-love, to stop posterity?",renaissance_love
"Thou art thy mothers glass, and she in thee",renaissance_love
Calls back the lovely April of her prime;,renaissance_love

"Despite of wrinkles, this thy golden time.",renaissance_love
"    But if thou live remembred not to be,",renaissance_love
"    Die single, and thine image dies with thee.",renaissance_love
    Shall I compare thee to a summers day?,renaissance_love
Thou art more lovely and more temperate:,renaissance_love
"Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,",renaissance_love
And summers lease hath all too short a date;,renaissance_love
"Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,",renaissance_love
And often is his gold complexion dimm'd;,renaissance_love
"And every fair from fair sometime declines,",renaissance_love
By chance or natures changing course untrimm'd;,renaissance_love
"But thy eternal summer shall not fade,",renaissance_love
Nor lose possession of that fair thou owst;,renaissance_love
"Nor shall death brag thou wanderst in his shade,",renaissance_love
When in eternal lines to time thou growst:,renaissance_love
"   So long as men can breathe or eyes can see,",renaissance_love
"   So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.",renaissance_love
   A womans face with natures own hand painted,renaissance_love
"Hast thou, the master-mistress of my passion;",renaissance_love
"A womans gentle heart, but not acquainted",renaissance_love
With shifting change as is false womens fashion;,renaissance_love
"An eye more bright than theirs, less false in rolling,",renaissance_love
Gilding the object whereupon it gazeth;,renaissance_love
"A man in hue, all hues in his controlling,",renaissance_love
Which steals mens eyes and womens souls amazeth.,renaissance_love
"And for a woman wert thou first created,",renaissance_love
"Till nature as she wrought thee fell a-doting,",renaissance_love
And by addition me of thee defeated,renaissance_love
By adding one thing to my purpose nothing.,renaissance_love
"      But since she pricked thee out for women's pleasure,",renaissance_love
      Mine be thy love and thy loves use their treasure.,renaissance_love
      No more be grieved at that which thou hast done:,renaissance_love
"Roses have thorns, and silver fountains mud,",renaissance_love
"Clouds and eclipses stain both moon and sun,",renaissance_love
And loathsome canker lives in sweetest bud.,renaissance_love
"All men make faults, and even I in this,",renaissance_love
"Authorizing thy trespass with compare,",renaissance_love
"Myself corrupting salving thy amiss,",renaissance_love
Excusing thy sins more than thy sins are:,renaissance_love
For to thy sensual fault I bring in sense,renaissance_love
Thy adverse party is thy advocate,renaissance_love
And gainst myself a lawful plea commence.,renaissance_love
"Such civil war is in my love and hate,",renaissance_love
   That I an accessory needs must be,renaissance_love
   To that sweet thief which sourly robs from me.,renaissance_love
"   Take all my loves, my love, yea, take them all:",renaissance_love
What hast thou then more than thou hadst before?,renaissance_love
"No love, my love, that thou mayst true love call",renaissance_love
All mine was thine before thou hadst this more.,renaissance_love
"Then if for my love thou my love receivest,",renaissance_love
I cannot blame thee for my love thou usest;,renaissance_love
But yet be blamed if thou this self deceivest,renaissance_love
By wilful taste of what thyself refusest.,renaissance_love
"I do forgive thy robbry, gentle thief,",renaissance_love
Although thou steal thee all my poverty;,renaissance_love
And yet love knows it is a greater grief,renaissance_love
To bear loves wrong than hates known injury.,renaissance_love
"    Lascivious grace, in whom all ill well shows,",renaissance_love
"    Kill me with spites, yet we must not be foes.",renaissance_love
    Not marble nor the gilded monuments,renaissance_love
"Of princes shall outlive this powerful rhyme,",renaissance_love
But you shall shine more bright in these contents,renaissance_love
Than unswept stone besmeared with sluttish time.,renaissance_love
"When wasteful war shall statues overturn,",renaissance_love
"And broils root out the work of masonry,",renaissance_love
Nor Mars his sword nor wars quick fire shall burn,renaissance_love
The living record of your memory.,renaissance_love
Gainst death and all-oblivious enmity,renaissance_love
Shall you pace forth; your praise shall still find room,renaissance_love
Even in the eyes of all posterity,renaissance_love
That wear this world out to the ending doom.,renaissance_love
"    So, till the Judgement that yourself arise,",renaissance_love
"    You live in this, and dwell in lovers eyes.",renaissance_love
"    Being your slave, what should I do but tend",renaissance_love
Upon the hours and times of your desire?,renaissance_love
"I have no precious time at all to spend,",renaissance_love
"Nor services to do, till you require.",renaissance_love
Nor dare I chide the world-without-end hour,renaissance_love
"Whilst I, my sovereign, watch the clock for you.",renaissance_love
Nor think the bitterness of absence sour,renaissance_love
When you have bid your servant once adieu;,renaissance_love
Nor dare I question with my jealous thought,renaissance_love
"Where you may be, or your affairs suppose,",renaissance_love
"But like a sad slave, stay and think of nought,",renaissance_love
"Save, where you are how happy you make those.",renaissance_love
So true a fool is love that in your will,renaissance_love
"Though you do anything, he thinks no ill.",renaissance_love
"Since brass, nor stone, nor earth, nor boundless sea",renaissance_love
"But sad mortality oer-sways their power,",renaissance_love
"How with this rage shall beauty hold a plea,",renaissance_love
Whose action is no stronger than a flower?,renaissance_love
"O, how shall summers honey breath hold out",renaissance_love
"Against the wrackful siege of battring days,",renaissance_love
"When rocks impregnable are not so stout,",renaissance_love
"Nor gates of steel so strong, but time decays?",renaissance_love
"O fearful meditation! where, alack,",renaissance_love
Shall times best jewel from times chest lie hid?,renaissance_love
Or what strong hand can hold his swift foot back?,renaissance_love
Or who his spoil of beauty can forbid?,renaissance_love
"   O, none, unless this miracle have might,",renaissance_love
   That in black ink my love may still shine bright.,renaissance_love
"   Why is my verse so barren of new pride,",renaissance_love
So far from variation or quick change?,renaissance_love
Why with the time do I not glance aside,renaissance_love
"To new-found methods, and to compounds strange?",renaissance_love
"Why write I still all one, ever the same,",renaissance_love
"And keep invention in a noted weed,",renaissance_love
"That every word doth almost tell my name,",renaissance_love
"Showing their birth, and where they did proceed?",renaissance_love
"O know, sweet love, I always write of you,",renaissance_love
"And you and love are still my argument,",renaissance_love
"So all my best is dressing old words new,",renaissance_love
Spending again what is already spent:,renaissance_love
"   For as the sun is daily new and old,",renaissance_love
   So is my love still telling what is told.,renaissance_love
"   Farewell! thou art too dear for my possessing,",renaissance_love
And like enough thou knowst thy estimate.,renaissance_love
The Charter of thy worth gives thee releasing;,renaissance_love
My bonds in thee are all determinate.,renaissance_love
"For how do I hold thee but by thy granting,",renaissance_love
And for that riches where is my deserving?,renaissance_love
"The cause of this fair gift in me is wanting,",renaissance_love
And so my patent back again is swerving.,renaissance_love
"Thy self thou gav'st, thy own worth then not knowing,",renaissance_love
"Or me, to whom thou gav'st it, else mistaking,",renaissance_love
"So thy great gift, upon misprision growing,",renaissance_love
"Comes home again, on better judgement making.",renaissance_love
   Thus have I had thee as a dream doth flatter:,renaissance_love
"   In sleep a king, but waking no such matter.",renaissance_love
"   From you have I been absent in the spring,",renaissance_love
"When proud-pied April, dressed in all his trim,",renaissance_love
"Hath put a spirit of youth in everything,",renaissance_love
That heavy Saturn laughed and leaped with him.,renaissance_love
"Yet nor the lays of birds, nor the sweet smell",renaissance_love
"Of different flowers in odour and in hue,",renaissance_love
"Could make me any summers story tell,",renaissance_love
Or from their proud lap pluck them where they grew:,renaissance_love
"Nor did I wonder at the lilys white,",renaissance_love
Nor praise the deep vermilion in the rose;,renaissance_love
"They were but sweet, but figures of delight",renaissance_love
"Drawn after you,  you pattern of all those.",renaissance_love
"    Yet seemd it winter still, and, you away,",renaissance_love
    As with your shadow I with these did play.,renaissance_love
"    To me, fair friend, you never can be old,",renaissance_love
"For as you were when first your eye I eyed,",renaissance_love
Such seems your beauty still. Three winters cold,renaissance_love
"Have from the forests shook three summers pride,",renaissance_love
Three beauteous springs to yellow autumn turned,renaissance_love
"In process of the seasons have I seen,",renaissance_love
"Three April perfumes in three hot Junes burned,",renaissance_love
"Since first I saw you fresh, which yet are green.",renaissance_love
"Ah, yet doth beauty, like a dial-hand,",renaissance_love
"Steal from his figure, and no pace perceived;",renaissance_love
"So your sweet hue, which methinks still doth stand,",renaissance_love
"Hath motion, and mine eye may be deceived:",renaissance_love
"For fear of which, hear this, thou age unbred:",renaissance_love
Ere you were born was beautys summer dead.,renaissance_love
"O! never say that I was false of heart,",renaissance_love
Though absence seemed my flame to qualify.,renaissance_love
As easy might I from myself depart,renaissance_love
"As from my soul, which in thy breast doth lie:",renaissance_love
"That is my home of love; if I have ranged,",renaissance_love
"Like him that travels, I return again,",renaissance_love
"Just to the time, not with the time exchanged,",renaissance_love
So that myself bring water for my stain.,renaissance_love
"Never believe, though in my nature reigned",renaissance_love
"All frailties that besiege all kinds of blood,",renaissance_love
"That it could so preposterously be stained,",renaissance_love
To leave for nothing all thy sum of good;,renaissance_love
"   For nothing this wide universe I call,",renaissance_love
"   Save thou, my rose; in it thou art my all.",renaissance_love
"   O thou, my lovely boy, who in thy powr",renaissance_love
"Dost hold times fickle glass his sickle hour,",renaissance_love
"Who hast by waning grown, and therein showst",renaissance_love
"Thy lovers withering, as thy sweet self growst",renaissance_love
"In nature, sovereign mistress over wrack,",renaissance_love
"As thou goest onwards still will pluck thee back,",renaissance_love
"She keeps thee to this purpose, that her skill",renaissance_love
"May time disgrace, and wretched minute kill.",renaissance_love
"Yet fear her, O thou minion of her pleasure;",renaissance_love
She may detain but not still keep her treasure.,renaissance_love
"   Her audit, though delayed, answered must be,",renaissance_love
   And her quietus is to render thee.,renaissance_love
"   Whoever hath her wish, thou hast thy Will,",renaissance_love
"And Will to boot, and Will in overplus;",renaissance_love
"More than enough am I that vex thee still,",renaissance_love
To thy sweet will making addition thus.,renaissance_love
"Wilt thou, whose will is large and spacious,",renaissance_love
Not once vouchsafe to hide my will in thine?,renaissance_love
"Shall will in others seem right gracious,",renaissance_love
And in my will no fair acceptance shine?,renaissance_love
"The sea, all water, yet receives rain still,",renaissance_love
And in abundance addeth to his store;,renaissance_love
So thou being rich in Will add to thy Will,renaissance_love
"One will of mine, to make thy large Will more.",renaissance_love
"   Let no unkind, no fair beseechers kill;",renaissance_love
"   Think all but one, and me in that one Will.",renaissance_love
"   When my love swears that she is made of truth,",renaissance_love
"I do believe her, though I know she lies,",renaissance_love
"That she might think me some untutored youth,",renaissance_love
Unlearned in the worlds false subtleties.,renaissance_love
"Thus vainly thinking that she thinks me young,",renaissance_love
"Although she knows my days are past the best,",renaissance_love
Simply I credit her false-speaking tongue:,renaissance_love
On both sides thus is simple truth suppressed.,renaissance_love
But wherefore says she not she is unjust?,renaissance_love
And wherefore say not I that I am old?,renaissance_love
"Oh, loves best habit is in seeming trust,",renaissance_love
And age in love loves not to have years told.,renaissance_love
"    Therefore I lie with her and she with me,",renaissance_love
    And in our faults by lies we flattered be.,renaissance_love
"    In faith, I do not love thee with mine eyes,",renaissance_love
For they in thee a thousand errors note;,renaissance_love
"But tis my heart that loves what they despise,",renaissance_love
"Who, in despite of view, is pleased to dote;",renaissance_love
"Nor are mine ears with thy tongues tune delighted,",renaissance_love
"Nor tender feeling, to base touches prone,",renaissance_love
"Nor taste, nor smell, desire to be invited",renaissance_love
To any sensual feast with thee alone:,renaissance_love
But my five wits nor my five senses can,renaissance_love
"Dissuade one foolish heart from serving thee,",renaissance_love
"Who leaves unswayed the likeness of a man,",renaissance_love
Thy proud hearts slave and vassal wretch to be.,renaissance_love
"   Only my plague thus far I count my gain,",renaissance_love
   That she that makes me sin awards me pain.,renaissance_love
"   Two loves I have of comfort and despair,",renaissance_love
Which like two spirits do suggest me still,renaissance_love
"The better angel is a man right fair,",renaissance_love
The worser spirit a woman coloured ill.,renaissance_love
"To win me soon to hell, my female evil",renaissance_love
"Tempteth my better angel from my side,",renaissance_love
"And would corrupt my saint to be a devil,",renaissance_love
Wooing his purity with her foul pride.,renaissance_love
"And, whether that my angel be turnd fiend,",renaissance_love
"Suspect I may, yet not directly tell,",renaissance_love
"But being both from me both to each friend,",renaissance_love
I guess one angel in anothers hell.,renaissance_love
"   Yet this shall I neer know, but live in doubt,",renaissance_love
   Till my bad angel fire my good one out.,renaissance_love
"   I that have been a lover, and could show it,",renaissance_love
"Though not in these, in rithmes not wholly dumb,",renaissance_love
"Since I exscribe your sonnets, am become",renaissance_love
"A better lover, and much better poet.",renaissance_love
Nor is my Muse or I ashamed to owe it,renaissance_love
"To those true numerous graces, whereof some",renaissance_love
"But charm the senses, others overcome",renaissance_love
Both brains and hearts; and mine now best do know it:,renaissance_love
"For in your verse all Cupids armory,",renaissance_love
"His flames, his shafts, his quiver, and his bow,",renaissance_love
His very eyes are yours to overthrow.,renaissance_love
"But then his mothers sweets you so apply,",renaissance_love
"Her joys, her smiles, her loves, as readers take",renaissance_love
For Venus ceston every line you make.,renaissance_love
"Take, oh, take those lips away",renaissance_love
That so sweetly were forsworn,renaissance_love
"And those eyes, like break of day,",renaissance_love
Lights that do mislead the morn;,renaissance_love
"But my kisses bring again,",renaissance_love
"Seals of love, though sealed in vain.",renaissance_love
"Hide, oh, hide those hills of snow,",renaissance_love
"Which thy frozen bosom bears,",renaissance_love
On whose tops the pinks that grow,renaissance_love
Are of those that April wears;,renaissance_love
"But first set my poor heart free,",renaissance_love
Bound in those icy chains by thee.,renaissance_love
"Though I am young, and cannot tell",renaissance_love
"    Either what Death or Love is well,",renaissance_love
"Yet I have heard they both bear darts,",renaissance_love
    And both do aim at human hearts.,renaissance_love
"And then again, I have been told",renaissance_love
"    Love wounds with heat, as Death with cold;",renaissance_love
So that I fear they do but bring,renaissance_love
"    Extremes to touch, and mean one thing.",renaissance_love
As in a ruin we it call,renaissance_love
"    One thing to be blown up, or fall;",renaissance_love
Or to our end like way may have,renaissance_love
"    By a flash of lightning, or a wave;",renaissance_love
So Loves inflamed shaft or brand,renaissance_love
    May kill as soon as Deaths cold hand;,renaissance_love
Except Loves fires the virtue have,renaissance_love
    To fright the frost out of the grave.,renaissance_love
"    Though that men do call it dotage,",renaissance_love
Who loveth not wanteth courage;,renaissance_love
"And whosoever may love get,",renaissance_love
From Venus sure he must it fet,renaissance_love
"Or else from her which is her heir,",renaissance_love
And she to him must seem most fair.,renaissance_love
With eye and mind doth both agree.,renaissance_love
There is no boot: there must it be.,renaissance_love
"The eye doth look and represent,",renaissance_love
But mind afformeth with full consent.,renaissance_love
Thus am I fixed without grudge:,renaissance_love
Mine eye with heart doth me so judge.,renaissance_love
Love maintaineth all noble courage.,renaissance_love
Who love disdaineth is all of the village:,renaissance_love
Such loversthough they take pain,renaissance_love
"It were pity they should obtain,",renaissance_love
For often times where they do sue,renaissance_love
They hinder lovers that would be true.,renaissance_love
For whoso loveth should love but once.,renaissance_love
"Change whoso will, I will be none.",renaissance_love
"Come, Madam, come, all rest my powers defy,",renaissance_love
"Until I labour, I in labour lie.",renaissance_love
"The foe oft-times having the foe in sight,",renaissance_love
Is tird with standing though he never fight.,renaissance_love
"Off with that girdle, like heavens Zone glistering,",renaissance_love
But a far fairer world encompassing.,renaissance_love
"Unpin that spangled breastplate which you wear,",renaissance_love
That theyes of busy fools may be stopped there.,renaissance_love
"Unlace yourself, for that harmonious chime,",renaissance_love
"Tells me from you, that now it is bed time.",renaissance_love
"Off with that happy busk, which I envy,",renaissance_love
"That still can be, and still can stand so nigh.",renaissance_love
"Your gown going off, such beauteous state reveals,",renaissance_love
As when from flowery meads thhills shadow steals.,renaissance_love
Off with that wiry Coronet and shew,renaissance_love
The hairy Diadem which on you doth grow:,renaissance_love
"Now off with those shoes, and then safely tread",renaissance_love
"In this loves hallowd temple, this soft bed.",renaissance_love
"In such white robes, heavens Angels used to be",renaissance_love
Received by men; Thou Angel bringst with thee,renaissance_love
A heaven like Mahomets Paradise; and though,renaissance_love
"Ill spirits walk in white, we easily know,",renaissance_love
"By this these Angels from an evil sprite,",renaissance_love
"Those set our hairs, but these our flesh upright.",renaissance_love
"    Licence my roving hands, and let them go,",renaissance_love
"Before, behind, between, above, below.",renaissance_love
"O my America! my new-found-land,",renaissance_love
"My kingdom, safeliest when with one man mannd,",renaissance_love
"My Mine of precious stones, My Empirie,",renaissance_love
How blest am I in this discovering thee!,renaissance_love
"To enter in these bonds, is to be free;",renaissance_love
"Then where my hand is set, my seal shall be.",renaissance_love
"    Full nakedness! All joys are due to thee,",renaissance_love
"As souls unbodied, bodies unclothd must be,",renaissance_love
To taste whole joys. Gems which you women use,renaissance_love
"Are like Atlantas balls, cast in mens views,",renaissance_love
"That when a fools eye lighteth on a Gem,",renaissance_love
"His earthly soul may covet theirs, not them.",renaissance_love
"Like pictures, or like books gay coverings made",renaissance_love
"For lay-men, are all women thus arrayd;",renaissance_love
"Themselves are mystic books, which only we",renaissance_love
(Whom their imputed grace will dignify),renaissance_love
Must see reveald. Then since that I may know;,renaissance_love
"As liberally, as to a Midwife, shew",renaissance_love
"Thy self: cast all, yea, this white linen hence,",renaissance_love
There is no penance due to innocence.,renaissance_love
"    To teach thee, I am naked first; why then",renaissance_love
What needst thou have more covering than a man.,renaissance_love
"Merry Margaret,",renaissance_love
"As midsummer flower,",renaissance_love
Gentle as a falcon,renaissance_love
Or hawk of the tower:,renaissance_love
"With solace and gladness,",renaissance_love
"Much mirth and no madness,",renaissance_love
All good and no badness;,renaissance_love
"So joyously,",renaissance_love
"So maidenly,",renaissance_love
So womanly,renaissance_love
Her demeaning,renaissance_love
"In every thing,",renaissance_love
"Far, far passing",renaissance_love
"That I can indite,",renaissance_love
Or suffice to write,renaissance_love
Of Merry Margaret,renaissance_love
"As midsummer flower,",renaissance_love
Gentle as falcon,renaissance_love
Or hawk of the tower.,renaissance_love
As patient and still,renaissance_love
And as full of good will,renaissance_love

"Coriander,",renaissance_love
"Sweet pomander,",renaissance_love
"Good Cassander,",renaissance_love
"Steadfast of thought,",renaissance_love
"Well made, well wrought,",renaissance_love
Far may be sought,renaissance_love
Ere that ye can find,renaissance_love
"So courteous, so kind",renaissance_love
"As Merry Margaret,",renaissance_love
"This midsummer flower,",renaissance_love
Gentle as falcon,renaissance_love
Or hawk of the tower.,renaissance_love
That neither fame nor love might wanting be,renaissance_love
"To greatness, Cary, I sing that and thee;",renaissance_love
"Whose house, if it no other honor had,",renaissance_love
In only thee might be both great and glad;,renaissance_love
"Who, to upbraid the sloth of this our time,",renaissance_love
"Durst valor make almost, but not, a crime;",renaissance_love
"Which deed I know not, whether were more high,",renaissance_love
"Or thou more happy, it to justify",renaissance_love
"Against thy fortune: when no foe, that day,",renaissance_love
"Could conquer thee but chance, who did betray.",renaissance_love
"Love thy great loss, which a renown hath won,",renaissance_love
"To live when Broick not stands, nor Ruhr doth run.",renaissance_love
"Love honors, which of best example be",renaissance_love
When they cost dearest and are done most free;,renaissance_love
"Though every fortitude deserves applause,",renaissance_love
It may be much or little in the cause.,renaissance_love
"Hes valiantst that dares fight, and not for pay;",renaissance_love
"That virtuous is, when the rewards away.",renaissance_love
"Methought I saw the grave where Laura lay,",renaissance_love
Within that temple where the vestal flame,renaissance_love
"Was wont to burn; and, passing by that way,",renaissance_love
"To see that buried dust of living fame,",renaissance_love
"Whose tomb fair Love, and fairer Virtue kept:",renaissance_love
All suddenly I saw the Fairy Queen;,renaissance_love
"At whose approach the soul of Petrarch wept,",renaissance_love
"And, from thenceforth, those Graces were not seen:",renaissance_love
For they this queen attended; in whose stead,renaissance_love
Oblivion laid him down on Lauras hearse:,renaissance_love
"Hereat the hardest stones were seen to bleed,",renaissance_love
And groans of buried ghosts the heavens did pierce:,renaissance_love
"Where Homers spright did tremble all for grief,",renaissance_love
And cursed the access of that celestial thief!,renaissance_love
"When thou must home to shades of underground,",renaissance_love
"And there arrived, a new admired guest,",renaissance_love
"The beauteous spirits do engirt thee round,",renaissance_love
"White Iope, blithe Helen, and the rest,",renaissance_love
To hear the stories of thy finished love,renaissance_love
From that smooth tongue whose music hell can move;,renaissance_love
"Then wilt thou speak of banqueting delights,",renaissance_love
"Of masques and revels which sweet youth did make,",renaissance_love
"Of tourneys and great challenges of knights,",renaissance_love
And all these triumphs for thy beautys sake:,renaissance_love
"When thou hast told these honours done to thee,",renaissance_love
"Then tell, O tell, how thou didst murder me!",renaissance_love
As you came from the holy land,renaissance_love
of Walsinghame,renaissance_love
Met you not with my true love,renaissance_love
By the way as you came?,renaissance_love
How shall I know your true love,renaissance_love
That have met many one,renaissance_love
As I went to the holy land,renaissance_love
"That have come, that have gone?",renaissance_love
She is neither white nor brown,renaissance_love
But as the heavens fair,renaissance_love
There is none hath a form so divine,renaissance_love
In the earth or the air.,renaissance_love
"Such an one did I meet, good Sir,",renaissance_love
"Such an Angelic face,",renaissance_love
"Who like a queen, like a nymph, did appear",renaissance_love
"By her gait, by her grace.",renaissance_love
"She hath left me here all alone,",renaissance_love
"All alone as unknown,",renaissance_love
"Who sometimes did me lead with her self,",renaissance_love
And me loved as her own.,renaissance_love
Whats the cause that she leaves you alone,renaissance_love
And a new way doth take;,renaissance_love
Who loved you once as her own,renaissance_love
And her joy did you make?,renaissance_love
"I have loved her all my youth,",renaissance_love
"But now old, as you see,",renaissance_love
Love likes not the falling fruit,renaissance_love
From the withered tree.,renaissance_love
Know that love is a careless child,renaissance_love
"And forgets promise past,",renaissance_love
"He is blind, he is deaf when he list",renaissance_love
And in faith never fast.,renaissance_love
His desire is a dureless content,renaissance_love
And a trustless joy,renaissance_love
He is won with a world of despair,renaissance_love
And is lost with a toy.,renaissance_love
Of womenkind such indeed is the love,renaissance_love
Or the word Love abused,renaissance_love
Under which many childish desires,renaissance_love
And conceits are excused.,renaissance_love
But true Love is a durable fire,renaissance_love
In the mind ever burning;,renaissance_love
"Never sick, never old, never dead,",renaissance_love
From itself never turning.,renaissance_love
"What length of verse can serve brave Mopsas good to show,",renaissance_love
"Whose virtues strange, and beauties such, as no man them may know?",renaissance_love

"Her twinkling eyes bedecked with pearl, her lips of sapphire blue,",renaissance_love
"Her hair pure crapall stone, her mouth, O heavenly wide,",renaissance_love
"Her skin like burnished gold, her hands like silver ore untried.",renaissance_love
"As for those parts unknown, which hidden sure are best,",renaissance_love
"Happy be they which believe, and never seek the rest.",renaissance_love
"When I was fair and young, then favor graced me.",renaissance_love
Of many was I sought their mistress for to be.,renaissance_love
But I did scorn them all and answered them therefore:,renaissance_love
"Go, go, go, seek some other where; importune me no more.",renaissance_love
"How many weeping eyes I made to pine in woe,",renaissance_love
"How many sighing hearts I have not skill to show,",renaissance_love
But I the prouder grew and still this spake therefore:,renaissance_love
"Go, go, go, seek some other where, importune me no more.",renaissance_love
"Then spake fair Venus son, that proud victorious boy,",renaissance_love
"Saying: You dainty dame, for that you be so coy,",renaissance_love
I will so pluck your plumes as you shall say no more:,renaissance_love
"Go, go, go, seek some other where, importune me no more.",renaissance_love
"As soon as he had said, such change grew in my breast",renaissance_love
That neither night nor day I could take any rest.,renaissance_love
Wherefore I did repent that I had said before:,renaissance_love
"Go, go, go, seek some other where, importune me no more.",renaissance_love
"When to her lute Corinna sings,",renaissance_love
"Her voice revives the leaden strings,",renaissance_love
And doth in highest notes appear,renaissance_love
As any challenged echo clear;,renaissance_love
"But when she doth of mourning speak,",renaissance_love
Evn with her sighs the strings do break.,renaissance_love
"And as her lute doth live or die,",renaissance_love
"Let by her passion, so must I:",renaissance_love
"For when of pleasure she doth sing,",renaissance_love
"My thoughts enjoy a sudden spring,",renaissance_love
"But if she doth of sorrow speak,",renaissance_love
Evn from my heart the strings do break.,renaissance_love
"Now thou has loved me one whole day,",renaissance_love
"Tomorrow when you leavst, what wilt thou say?",renaissance_love
Wilt thou then antedate some new-made vow?,renaissance_love
            Or say that now,renaissance_love
We are not just those persons which we were?,renaissance_love
"Or, that oaths made in reverential fear",renaissance_love
"Of Love, and his wrath, any may forswear?",renaissance_love
"Or, as true deaths true marriages untie,",renaissance_love
"So lovers contracts, images of those,",renaissance_love
"Bind but till sleep, deaths image, them unloose?",renaissance_love
"            Or, your own end to justify,",renaissance_love
"For having purposed change and falsehood, you",renaissance_love
Can have no way but falsehood to be true?,renaissance_love
"Vain lunatic, against these scapes I could",renaissance_love
"            Dispute and conquer, if I would,",renaissance_love
"            Which I abstain to do,",renaissance_love
"For by tomorrow, I may think so too.",renaissance_love
"Womanhood, wanton, ye want:",renaissance_love
"Your meddling, mistress, is mannerless;",renaissance_love
"Plenty of ill, of goodness scant,",renaissance_love
"Ye rail at riot, reckless:",renaissance_love
To praise your port it is needless;,renaissance_love
"For all your draff yet and your dregs,",renaissance_love
As well borne as ye full oft time begs.,renaissance_love
Why so coy and full of scorn?,renaissance_love
"Mine horse is sold, I ween, you say;",renaissance_love
"My new furred gown, when it is worn...",renaissance_love
"Put up your purse, ye shall not pay!",renaissance_love
"By crede, I trust to see the day,",renaissance_love
"As proud a pea-hen as ye spread,",renaissance_love
Of me and other ye may have need!,renaissance_love
"Though angelic be your smiling,",renaissance_love
"Yet is your tongue an adders tail,",renaissance_love
Full like a scorpion stinging,renaissance_love
All those by whom ye have avail.,renaissance_love
"Good mistress Anne, there ye do shail:",renaissance_love
"What prate ye, pretty pigesnye?",renaissance_love
I trust to quite you ere I die!,renaissance_love
"Your key is meet for every lock,",renaissance_love
Your key is common and hangeth out;,renaissance_love
"Your key is ready, we need not knock,",renaissance_love
Nor stand long wresting there about;,renaissance_love
Of your door-gate ye have no doubt:,renaissance_love
"But one thing is, that ye be lewd:",renaissance_love
"Hold your tongue now, all beshrewd!",renaissance_love
"To mistress Anne, that farly sweet,",renaissance_love
That wones at The Key in Thames Street.,renaissance_love
" Wyatt resteth here, that quick could never rest;",renaissance_love
"Whose heavenly gifts increased by disdain,",renaissance_love
And virtue sank the deeper in his breast;,renaissance_love
Such profit he of envy could obtain.,renaissance_love
"A head, where wisdom mysteries did frame,",renaissance_love
Whose hammers beat still in that lively brain,renaissance_love
"As on a stith, where some work of fame",renaissance_love
"Was daily wrought, to turn to Britains gain.",renaissance_love
"A visage, stern and mild; where both did grow,",renaissance_love
"Vice to condemn, in virtues to rejoice;",renaissance_love
"Amid great storms whom grace assured so,",renaissance_love
To live upright and smile at fortunes choice.,renaissance_love
A hand that taught what might be said in rhyme;,renaissance_love
That reft Chaucer the glory of his wit;,renaissance_love
"A mark the which (unperfited, for time)",renaissance_love
"Some may approach, but never none shall hit.",renaissance_love
A tongue that served in foreign realms his king;,renaissance_love
Whose courteous talk to virtue did enflame,renaissance_love
Each noble heart; a worthy guide to bring,renaissance_love
"Our English youth, by travail unto fame.",renaissance_love
"An eye whose judgment no affect could blind,",renaissance_love
"Friends to allure, and foes to reconcile;",renaissance_love
Whose piercing look did represent a mind,renaissance_love
"With virtue fraught, reposed, void of guile.",renaissance_love
A heart where dread yet never so impressed,renaissance_love
To hide the thought that might the truth avaunce;,renaissance_love
"In neither fortune lift, nor so repressed,",renaissance_love
"To swell in wealth, nor yield unto mischance.",renaissance_love
"A valiant corps, where force and beauty met,",renaissance_love
"Happy, alas! too happy, but for foes,",renaissance_love
"Lived, and ran the race that nature set;",renaissance_love
"Of manhoods shape, where she the mold did lose.",renaissance_love
"But to the heavens that simple soul is fled,",renaissance_love
"Which left with such, as covet Christ to know",renaissance_love
Witness of faith that never shall be dead:,renaissance_love
"Sent for our health, but not received so.",renaissance_love
"Thus, for our guilt, this jewel have we lost;",renaissance_love
"The earth his bones, the heavens possess his ghost.",renaissance_love
"Amen.Twice or thrice had I lov'd thee,",renaissance_love
Before I knew thy face or name;,renaissance_love
"So in a voice, so in a shapeless flame",renaissance_love
"Angels affect us oft, and worshipp'd be;",renaissance_love
"         Still when, to where thou wert, I came,",renaissance_love
Some lovely glorious nothing I did see.,renaissance_love
"         But since my soul, whose child love is,",renaissance_love
"Takes limbs of flesh, and else could nothing do,",renaissance_love
         More subtle than the parent is,renaissance_love
"Love must not be, but take a body too;",renaissance_love
"         And therefore what thou wert, and who,",renaissance_love
"                I bid Love ask, and now",renaissance_love
"That it assume thy body, I allow,",renaissance_love
"And fix itself in thy lip, eye, and brow.",renaissance_love
"Whilst thus to ballast love I thought,",renaissance_love
"And so more steadily to have gone,",renaissance_love
"With wares which would sink admiration,",renaissance_love
I saw I had love's pinnace overfraught;,renaissance_love
         Ev'ry thy hair for love to work upon,renaissance_love
"Is much too much, some fitter must be sought;",renaissance_love
"         For, nor in nothing, nor in things",renaissance_love
"Extreme, and scatt'ring bright, can love inhere;",renaissance_love
"         Then, as an angel, face, and wings",renaissance_love
"Of air, not pure as it, yet pure, doth wear,",renaissance_love
         So thy love may be my love's sphere;,renaissance_love
                Just such disparity,renaissance_love
"As is 'twixt air and angels' purity,",renaissance_love
"'Twixt women's love, and men's, will ever be.",renaissance_love
"Alas, madam, for stealing of a kiss",renaissance_love
Have I so much your mind there offended?,renaissance_love
Have I then done so grievously amiss,renaissance_love
That by no means it may be amended?,renaissance_love
"Then revenge you, and the next way is this:",renaissance_love
"Another kiss shall have my life ended,",renaissance_love
For to my mouth the first my heart did suck;,renaissance_love
The next shall clean out of my breast it pluck.,renaissance_love
"The sovereign beauty which I do admire,",renaissance_love
Witness the world how worthy to be praised:,renaissance_love
The light whereof hath kindled heavenly fire,renaissance_love
"In my frail spirit, by her from baseness raised;",renaissance_love
"That being now with her huge brightness dazed,",renaissance_love
Base thing I can no more endure to view;,renaissance_love
"But looking still on her, I stand amazed",renaissance_love
At wondrous sight of so celestial hue.,renaissance_love
"So when my tongue would speak her praises due,",renaissance_love
It stopped is with thought's astonishment:,renaissance_love
"And when my pen would write her titles true,",renaissance_love
It ravish'd is with fancy's wonderment:,renaissance_love
Yet in my heart I then both speak and write,renaissance_love
The wonder that my wit cannot endite.,renaissance_love
"ike as a huntsman after weary chase,",renaissance_love
"Seeing the game from him escap'd away,",renaissance_love
"Sits down to rest him in some shady place,",renaissance_love
With panting hounds beguiled of their prey:,renaissance_love
"So after long pursuit and vain assay,",renaissance_love
"When I all weary had the chase forsook,",renaissance_love
"The gentle deer return'd the self-same way,",renaissance_love
Thinking to quench her thirst at the next brook.,renaissance_love
"There she beholding me with milder look,",renaissance_love
"Sought not to fly, but fearless still did bide:",renaissance_love
"Till I in hand her yet half trembling took,",renaissance_love
And with her own goodwill her firmly tied.,renaissance_love
"Strange thing, me seem'd, to see a beast so wild,",renaissance_love
"So goodly won, with her own will beguil'd.",renaissance_love
"Most happy letters, fram'd by skilful trade,",renaissance_love
With which that happy name was first design'd:,renaissance_love
"The which three times thrice happy hath me made,",renaissance_love
"With gifts of body, fortune, and of mind.",renaissance_love
"The first my being to me gave by kind,",renaissance_love
"From mother's womb deriv'd by due descent,",renaissance_love
"The second is my sovereign Queen most kind,",renaissance_love
That honour and large richesse to me lent.,renaissance_love
"The third my love, my life's last ornament,",renaissance_love
By whom my spirit out of dust was raised:,renaissance_love
"To speak her praise and glory excellent,",renaissance_love
Of all alive most worthy to be praised.,renaissance_love
"Ye three Elizabeths for ever live,",renaissance_love
That three such graces did unto me give.,renaissance_love
"Men call you fair, and you do credit it,",renaissance_love
For that your self ye daily such do see:,renaissance_love
"But the true fair, that is the gentle wit,",renaissance_love
"And vertuous mind, is much more prais'd of me.",renaissance_love
"For all the rest, how ever fair it be,",renaissance_love
Shall turn to naught and lose that glorious hue:,renaissance_love
But only that is permanent and free,renaissance_love
"From frail corruption, that doth flesh ensue.",renaissance_love
That is true beauty: that doth argue you,renaissance_love
"To be divine, and born of heavenly seed:",renaissance_love
"Deriv'd from that fair Spirit, from whom all true",renaissance_love
And perfect beauty did at first proceed.,renaissance_love
"He only fair, and what he fair hath made,",renaissance_love
"All other fair, like flowers untimely fade.",renaissance_love
"One day I wrote her name upon the strand,",renaissance_love
But came the waves and washed it away:,renaissance_love
"Again I wrote it with a second hand,",renaissance_love
"But came the tide, and made my pains his prey.",renaissance_love
"Vain man, said she, ""that dost in vain assay,",renaissance_love
A mortal thing so to immortalize;,renaissance_love
"For I myself shall like to this decay,",renaissance_love
"And eke my name be wiped out likewise.""",renaissance_love
"Not so, (quod I) ""let baser things devise",renaissance_love
"To die in dust, but you shall live by fame:",renaissance_love
"My verse your vertues rare shall eternize,",renaissance_love
And in the heavens write your glorious name:,renaissance_love
"Where whenas death shall all the world subdue,",renaissance_love
"Our love shall live, and later life renew.",renaissance_love
"This holy season, fit to fast and pray,",renaissance_love
Men to devotion ought to be inclin'd:,renaissance_love
"Therefore I likewise on so holy day,",renaissance_love
For my sweet saint some service fit will find.,renaissance_love
"Her temple fair is built within my mind,",renaissance_love
"In which her glorious image placed is,",renaissance_love
"On which my thoughts do day and night attend,",renaissance_love
Like sacred priests that never think amiss.,renaissance_love
"There I to her as th' author of my bliss,",renaissance_love
Will build an altar to appease her ire:,renaissance_love
"And on the same my heart will sacrifice,",renaissance_love
Burning in flames of pure and chaste desire:,renaissance_love
"The which vouchsafe, O goddess, to accept,",renaissance_love
Amongst thy dearest relics to be kept.,renaissance_love
"AH whither, Love, wilt thou now carry me?",renaissance_love
What wontless fury dost thou now inspire,renaissance_love
"Into my feeble breast, too full of thee?",renaissance_love
"Whilst seeking to aslake thy raging fire,",renaissance_love
"Thou in me kindlest much more great desire,",renaissance_love
And up aloft above my strength dost raise,renaissance_love
The wondrous matter of my fire to praise.,renaissance_love
"That as I erst in praise of thine own name,",renaissance_love
"So now in honour of thy mother dear,",renaissance_love
"An honourable hymn I eke should frame,",renaissance_love
"And with the brightness of her beauty clear,",renaissance_love
The ravish'd hearts of gazeful men might rear,renaissance_love
"To admiration of that heavenly light,",renaissance_love
From whence proceeds such soul-enchanting might.,renaissance_love
"Thereto do thou, great goddess, queen of beauty,",renaissance_love
"Mother of love, and of all world's delight,",renaissance_love
Without whose sovereign grace and kindly duty,renaissance_love
"Nothing on earth seems fair to fleshly sight,",renaissance_love
Do thou vouchsafe with thy love-kindling light,renaissance_love
"T' illuminate my dim and dulled eyne,",renaissance_love
And beautify this sacred hymn of thine:,renaissance_love
"That both to thee, to whom I mean it most,",renaissance_love
"And eke to her, whose fair immortal beam",renaissance_love
"Hath darted fire into my feeble ghost,",renaissance_love
"That now it wasted is with woes extreme,",renaissance_love
"It may so please, that she at length will stream",renaissance_love
"Some dew of grace into my withered heart,",renaissance_love
After long sorrow and consuming smart.,renaissance_love
WHAT time this world's great Workmaster did cast,renaissance_love
"To make all things such as we now behold,",renaissance_love
It seems that he before his eyes had plac'd,renaissance_love
"A goodly pattern, to whose perfect mould",renaissance_love
He fashion'd them as comely as he could;,renaissance_love
"That now so fair and seemly they appear,",renaissance_love
As nought may be amended anywhere.,renaissance_love
"That wondrous pattern, wheresoe'er it be,",renaissance_love
"Whether in earth laid up in secret store,",renaissance_love
"Or else in heaven, that no man may it see",renaissance_love
"With sinful eyes, for fear it to deflore,",renaissance_love
"Is perfect Beauty, which all men adore;",renaissance_love
Whose face and feature doth so much excel,renaissance_love
"All mortal sense, that none the same may tell.",renaissance_love
Thereof as every earthly thing partakes,renaissance_love
"Or more or less, by influence divine,",renaissance_love
"So it more fair accordingly it makes,",renaissance_love
"And the gross matter of this earthly mine,",renaissance_love
"Which clotheth it, thereafter doth refine,",renaissance_love
Doing away the dross which dims the light,renaissance_love
Of that fair beam which therein is empight.,renaissance_love
"For, through infusion of celestial power,",renaissance_love
"The duller earth it quick'neth with delight,",renaissance_love
And lifeful spirits privily doth pour,renaissance_love
"Through all the parts, that to the looker's sight",renaissance_love
"They seem to please. That is thy sovereign might,",renaissance_love
"O Cyprian queen, which flowing from the beam",renaissance_love
"Of thy bright star, thou into them dost stream.",renaissance_love
That is the thing which giveth pleasant grace,renaissance_love
"To all things fair, that kindleth lively fire,",renaissance_love
"Light of thy lamp, which, shining in the face,",renaissance_love
"Thence to the soul darts amorous desire,",renaissance_love
And robs the hearts of those which it admire;,renaissance_love
"Therewith thou pointest thy son's poison'd arrow,",renaissance_love
"That wounds the life, and wastes the inmost marrow.",renaissance_love
"How vainly then do idle wits invent,",renaissance_love
That beauty is nought else but mixture made,renaissance_love
"Of colours fair, and goodly temp'rament",renaissance_love
"Of pure complexions, that shall quickly fade",renaissance_love
"And pass away, like to a summer's shade;",renaissance_love
Or that it is but comely composition,renaissance_love
"Of parts well measur'd, with meet disposition.",renaissance_love
"Hath white and red in it such wondrous power,",renaissance_love
"That it can pierce through th' eyes unto the heart,",renaissance_love
"And therein stir such rage and restless stour,",renaissance_love
As nought but death can stint his dolour's smart?,renaissance_love
Or can proportion of the outward part,renaissance_love
"Move such affection in the inward mind,",renaissance_love
That it can rob both sense and reason blind?,renaissance_love
"Why do not then the blossoms of the field,",renaissance_love
"Which are array'd with much more orient hue,",renaissance_love
"And to the sense most dainty odours yield,",renaissance_love
Work like impression in the looker's view?,renaissance_love
"Or why do not fair pictures like power shew,",renaissance_love
In which oft-times we nature see of art,renaissance_love
"Excell'd, in perfect limning every part?",renaissance_love
"But ah, believe me, there is more than so,",renaissance_love
That works such wonders in the minds of men;,renaissance_love
"I, that have often prov'd, too well it know,",renaissance_love
"And whoso list the like assays to ken,",renaissance_love
"Shall find by trial, and confess it then,",renaissance_love
"That beauty is not, as fond men misdeem,",renaissance_love
"An outward shew of things, that only seem.",renaissance_love
"For that same goodly hue of white and red,",renaissance_love
"With which the cheeks are sprinkled, shall decay,",renaissance_love
"And those sweet rosy leaves, so fairly spread",renaissance_love
"Upon the lips, shall fade and fall away",renaissance_love
"To that they were, even to corrupted clay;",renaissance_love
"That golden wire, those sparkling stars so bright,",renaissance_love
Shall turn to dust; and lose their goodly light.,renaissance_love
"But that fair lamp, from whose celestial ray",renaissance_love
"That light proceeds, which kindleth lovers' fire,",renaissance_love
Shall never be extinguish'd nor decay;,renaissance_love
"But when the vital spirits do expire,",renaissance_love
Unto her native planet shall retire;,renaissance_love
"For it is heavenly born and cannot die,",renaissance_love
Being a parcel of the purest sky.,renaissance_love
"For when the soul, the which derived was,",renaissance_love
"At first, out of that great immortal Spright,",renaissance_love
"By whom all live to love, whilom did pass",renaissance_love
Down from the top of purest heaven's height,renaissance_love
"To be embodied here, it then took light",renaissance_love
"And lively spirits from that fairest star,",renaissance_love
Which lights the world forth from his fiery car.,renaissance_love
"Which power retaining still or more or less,",renaissance_love
"When she in fleshly seed is eft enraced,",renaissance_love
"Through every part she doth the same impress,",renaissance_love
"According as the heavens have her graced,",renaissance_love
"And frames her house, in which she will be placed,",renaissance_love
"Fit for herself, adorning it with spoil",renaissance_love
Of th' heavenly riches which she robb'd erewhile.,renaissance_love
"Thereof it comes that these fair souls, which have",renaissance_love
"The most resemblance of that heavenly light,",renaissance_love
Frame to themselves most beautiful and brave,renaissance_love
"Their fleshly bower, most fit for their delight,",renaissance_love
And the gross matter by a sovereign might,renaissance_love
"Tempers so trim, that it may well be seen",renaissance_love
A palace fit for such a virgin queen.,renaissance_love
"So every spirit, as it is most pure,",renaissance_love
"And hath in it the more of heavenly light,",renaissance_love
So it the fairer body doth procure,renaissance_love
"To habit in, and it more fairly dight",renaissance_love
With cheerful grace and amiable sight.,renaissance_love
For of the soul the body form doth take:,renaissance_love
"For soul is form, and doth the body make.",renaissance_love
Therefore wherever that thou dost behold,renaissance_love
"A comely corpse, with beauty fair endued,",renaissance_love
"Know this for certain, that the same doth hold",renaissance_love
"A beauteous soul, with fair conditions thewed,",renaissance_love
Fit to receive the seed of virtue strewed.,renaissance_love
"For all that fair is, is by nature good;",renaissance_love
That is a sign to know the gentle blood.,renaissance_love
Yet oft it falls that many a gentle mind,renaissance_love
"Dwells in deformed tabernacle drown'd,",renaissance_love
"Either by chance, against the course of kind,",renaissance_love
"Or through unaptness in the substance found,",renaissance_love
"Which it assumed of some stubborn ground,",renaissance_love
"That will not yield unto her form's direction,",renaissance_love
But is deform'd with some foul imperfection.,renaissance_love
"And oft it falls, (ay me, the more to rue)",renaissance_love
"That goodly beauty, albe heavenly born,",renaissance_love
"Is foul abus'd, and that celestial hue,",renaissance_love
"Which doth the world with her delight adorn,",renaissance_love
"Made but the bait of sin, and sinners' scorn,",renaissance_love
"Whilst every one doth seek and sue to have it,",renaissance_love
But every one doth seek but to deprave it.,renaissance_love
"Yet nathemore is that fair beauty's blame,",renaissance_love
But theirs that do abuse it unto ill:,renaissance_love
"Nothing so good, but that through guilty shame",renaissance_love
"May be corrupt, and wrested unto will:",renaissance_love
"Natheless the soul is fair and beauteous still,",renaissance_love
"However flesh{""e}s fault it filthy make;",renaissance_love
For things immortal no corruption take.,renaissance_love
"But ye fair dames, the world's dear ornaments",renaissance_love
"And lively images of heaven's light,",renaissance_love
Let not your beams with such disparagements,renaissance_love
"Be dimm'd, and your bright glory dark'ned quite;",renaissance_love
"But mindful still of your first country's sight,",renaissance_love
"Do still preserve your first informed grace,",renaissance_love
Whose shadow yet shines in your beauteous face.,renaissance_love
"Loathe that foul blot, that hellish firebrand,",renaissance_love
"Disloyal lust, fair beauty's foulest blame,",renaissance_love
"That base affections, which your ears would bland,",renaissance_love
"Commend to you by love's abused name,",renaissance_love
But is indeed the bondslave of defame;,renaissance_love
"Which will the garland of your glory mar,",renaissance_love
And quench the light of your bright shining star.,renaissance_love
"But gentle Love, that loyal is and true,",renaissance_love
"Will more illumine your resplendent ray,",renaissance_love
"And add more brightness to your goodly hue,",renaissance_love
"From light of his pure fire; which, by like way",renaissance_love
"Kindled of yours, your likeness doth display;",renaissance_love
"Like as two mirrors, by oppos'd reflection,",renaissance_love
Do both express the face's first impression.,renaissance_love
"Therefore, to make your beauty more appear,",renaissance_love
"It you behoves to love, and forth to lay",renaissance_love
"That heavenly riches which in you ye bear,",renaissance_love
That men the more admire their fountain may;,renaissance_love
"For else what booteth that celestial ray,",renaissance_love
"If it in darkness be enshrined ever,",renaissance_love
That it of loving eyes be viewed never?,renaissance_love
"But, in your choice of loves, this well advise,",renaissance_love
"That likest to yourselves ye them select,",renaissance_love
"The which your forms' first source may sympathize,",renaissance_love
And with like beauty's parts be inly deckt;,renaissance_love
"For, if you loosely love without respect,",renaissance_love
"It is no love, but a discordant war,",renaissance_love
Whose unlike parts amongst themselves do jar.,renaissance_love
For love is a celestial harmony,renaissance_love
"Of likely hearts compos'd of stars' concent,",renaissance_love
"Which join together in sweet sympathy,",renaissance_love
"To work each other's joy and true content,",renaissance_love
Which they have harbour'd since their first descent,renaissance_love
"Out of their heavenly bowers, where they did see",renaissance_love
And know each other here belov'd to be.,renaissance_love
Then wrong it were that any other twain,renaissance_love
Should in love's gentle band combined be,renaissance_love
"But those whom Heaven did at first ordain,",renaissance_love
And made out of one mould the more t' agree;,renaissance_love
"For all that like the beauty which they see,",renaissance_love
Straight do not love; for love is not so light,renaissance_love
As straight to burn at first beholder's sight.,renaissance_love
"But they, which love indeed, look otherwise,",renaissance_love
"With pure regard and spotless true intent,",renaissance_love
Drawing out of the object of their eyes,renaissance_love
"A more refined form, which they present",renaissance_love
"Unto their mind, void of all blemishment;",renaissance_love
"Which it reducing to her first perfection,",renaissance_love
Beholdeth free from flesh's frail infection.,renaissance_love
"And then conforming it unto the light,",renaissance_love
"Which in itself it hath remaining still,",renaissance_love
"Of that first Sun, yet sparkling in his sight,",renaissance_love
Thereof he fashions in his higher skill,renaissance_love
An heavenly beauty to his fancy's will;,renaissance_love
"And it embracing in his mind entire,",renaissance_love
The mirror of his own thought doth admire.,renaissance_love
"Which seeing now so inly fair to be,",renaissance_love
"As outward it appeareth to the eye,",renaissance_love
"And with his spirit's proportion to agree,",renaissance_love
"He thereon fixeth all his fantasy,",renaissance_love
And fully setteth his felicity;,renaissance_love
"Counting it fairer than it is indeed,",renaissance_love
And yet indeed her fairness doth exceed.,renaissance_love
For lovers' eyes more sharply sighted be,renaissance_love
"Than other men's, and in dear love's delight",renaissance_love
"See more than any other eyes can see,",renaissance_love
"Through mutual receipt of beam{""e}s bright,",renaissance_love
"Which carry privy message to the spright,",renaissance_love
"And to their eyes that inmost fair display,",renaissance_love
As plain as light discovers dawning day.,renaissance_love
"Therein they see, through amorous eye-glances,",renaissance_love
"Armies of loves still flying to and fro,",renaissance_love
Which dart at them their little fiery lances;,renaissance_love
"Whom having wounded, back again they go,",renaissance_love
Carrying compassion to their lovely foe;,renaissance_love
"Who, seeing her fair eyes' so sharp effect,",renaissance_love
Cures all their sorrows with one sweet aspect.,renaissance_love
In which how many wonders do they rede,renaissance_love
"To their conceit, that others never see,",renaissance_love
"Now of her smiles, with which their souls they feed,",renaissance_love
Like gods with nectar in their banquets free;,renaissance_love
"Now of her looks, which like to cordials be;",renaissance_love
"But when her words' embassade forth she sends,",renaissance_love
"Lord, how sweet music that unto them lends.",renaissance_love
Sometimes upon her forehead they behold,renaissance_love
A thousand graces masking in delight;,renaissance_love
Sometimes within her eyelids they unfold,renaissance_love
"Ten thousand sweet belgards, which to their sight",renaissance_love
Do seem like twinkling stars in frosty night;,renaissance_love
"But on her lips, like rosy buds in May,",renaissance_love
So many millions of chaste pleasures play.,renaissance_love
"All those, O Cytherea, and thousands more",renaissance_love
"Thy handmaids be, which do on thee attend,",renaissance_love
"To deck thy beauty with their dainties' store,",renaissance_love
"That may it more to mortal eyes commend,",renaissance_love
And make it more admir'd of foe and friend:,renaissance_love
"That in men's hearts thou may'st thy throne install,",renaissance_love
And spread thy lovely kingdom over all.,renaissance_love
"Then Io, triumph! O great Beauty's Queen,",renaissance_love
"Advance the banner of thy conquest high,",renaissance_love
"That all this world, the which thy vassals bene,",renaissance_love
"May draw to thee, and with due fealty",renaissance_love
"Adore the power of thy great majesty,",renaissance_love
"Singing this hymn in honour of thy name,",renaissance_love
"Compil'd by me, which thy poor liegeman am.",renaissance_love
"In lieu whereof grant, O great sovereign,",renaissance_love
That she whose conquering beauty doth captive,renaissance_love
"My trembling heart in her eternal chain,",renaissance_love
"One drop of grace at length will to me give,",renaissance_love
"That I her bounden thrall by her may live,",renaissance_love
"And this same life, which first fro me she reaved,",renaissance_love
"May owe to her, of whom I it received.",renaissance_love
"And you, fair Venus' darling, my dear dread,",renaissance_love
"Fresh flower of grace, great goddess of my life,",renaissance_love
"When your fair eyes these fearful lines shall read,",renaissance_love
"Deign to let fall one drop of due relief,",renaissance_love
"That may recure my heart's long pining grief,",renaissance_love
"And shew what wondrous power your beauty hath,",renaissance_love
That can restore a damned wight from death.,renaissance_love
And wilt thou leave me thus?,renaissance_love
"Say nay, say nay, for shame,",renaissance_love
To save thee from the blame,renaissance_love
Of all my grief and grame;,renaissance_love
And wilt thou leave me thus?,renaissance_love
"Say nay, say nay!",renaissance_love
"And wilt thou leave me thus,",renaissance_love
That hath loved thee so long,renaissance_love
In wealth and woe among?,renaissance_love
And is thy heart so strong,renaissance_love
As for to leave me thus?,renaissance_love
"Say nay, say nay!",renaissance_love
"And wilt thou leave me thus,",renaissance_love
That hath given thee my heart,renaissance_love
"Never for to depart,",renaissance_love
Nother for pain nor smart;,renaissance_love
And wilt thou leave me thus?,renaissance_love
"Say nay, say nay!",renaissance_love
And wilt thou leave me thus,renaissance_love
And have no more pity,renaissance_love
Of him that loveth thee?,renaissance_love
"Helas, thy cruelty!",renaissance_love
And wilt thou leave me thus?,renaissance_love
"Say nay, say nay!Loving in truth, and fain in verse my love to show,",renaissance_love
"That she, dear she, might take some pleasure of my pain,",renaissance_love
"Pleasure might cause her read, reading might make her know,",renaissance_love
"Knowledge might pity win, and pity grace obtain,",renaissance_love
I sought fit words to paint the blackest face of woe;,renaissance_love
"Studying inventions fine her wits to entertain,",renaissance_love
"Oft turning others' leaves, to see if thence would flow",renaissance_love
Some fresh and fruitful showers upon my sunburn'd brain.,renaissance_love
"But words came halting forth, wanting invention's stay;",renaissance_love
"Invention, Nature's child, fled step-dame Study's blows;",renaissance_love
And others' feet still seem'd but strangers in my way.,renaissance_love
"Thus great with child to speak and helpless in my throes,",renaissance_love
"Biting my truant pen, beating myself for spite,",renaissance_love
"Fool, said my Muse to me, ""look in thy heart, and write.""",renaissance_love
You that do search for every purling spring,renaissance_love
"Which from the ribs of old Parnassus flows,",renaissance_love
"And every flower, not sweet perhaps, which grows",renaissance_love
"Near thereabouts, into your poesy wring;",renaissance_love
Ye that do dictionary's method bring,renaissance_love
"Into your rimes, running in rattling rows;",renaissance_love
You that poor Petrarch's long-deceased woes,renaissance_love
With new-born sighs and denizen'd wit do sing:,renaissance_love
You take wrong ways; those far-fet helps be such,renaissance_love
"As do bewray a want of inward touch,",renaissance_love
"And sure, at length stol'n goods do come to light.",renaissance_love
"But if, both for your love and skill, your name",renaissance_love
"You seek to nurse at fullest breasts of Fame,",renaissance_love
"Stella behold, and then begin to endite.",renaissance_love
"Fly, fly, my friends, I have my death wound, fly!",renaissance_love
"See there that boy, that murd'ring boy, I say,",renaissance_love
"Who, like a thief, hid in dark bush doth lie",renaissance_love
Till bloody bullet get him wrongful prey.,renaissance_love
"So tyrant he no fitter place could spy,",renaissance_love
"Nor so fair level in so secret stay,",renaissance_love
As that sweet black which veils the heav'nly eye;,renaissance_love
There himself with his shot he close doth lay.,renaissance_love
"Poor passenger, pass now thereby I did,",renaissance_love
"And stay'd, pleas'd with the prospect of the place,",renaissance_love
While that black hue from me the bad guest hid;,renaissance_love
But straight I saw motions of lightning grace,renaissance_love
And then descried the glist'ring of his dart:,renaissance_love
But ere I could fly thence it pierc'd my heart.,renaissance_love
"The curious wits, seeing dull pensiveness",renaissance_love
"Bewray itself in my long-settl'd eyes,",renaissance_love
"Whence those same fumes of melancholy rise,",renaissance_love
With idle pains and missing aim do guess.,renaissance_love
"Some, that know how my spring I did address,",renaissance_love
Deem that my Muse some fruit of knowledge plies;,renaissance_love
"Others, because the prince my service tries,",renaissance_love
Think that I think state errors to redress;,renaissance_love
But harder judges judge ambition's ragei,renaissance_love
"Scourge of itself, still climbing slipp'ry placei",renaissance_love
Holds my young brain captiv'd in golden cage.,renaissance_love
"O fool or over-wise! alas, the race",renaissance_love
Of all my thoughts hath neither stop nor start,renaissance_love
But only Stella's eyes and Stella's heart.,renaissance_love
"Let dainty wits cry on the sisters nine,",renaissance_love
"That, bravely mask'd, their fancies may be told;",renaissance_love
"Or, Pindar's apes, flaunt they in phrases fine,",renaissance_love
Enam'ling with pied flowers their thoughts of gold.,renaissance_love
"Or else let them in statelier glory shine,",renaissance_love
Ennobling newfound tropes with problems old;,renaissance_love
"Or with strange similes enrich each line,",renaissance_love
Of herbs or beasts which Ind or Afric hold.,renaissance_love
"For me, in sooth, no Muse but one I know;",renaissance_love
"Phrases and problems from my reach do grow,",renaissance_love
And strange things cost too dear for my poor sprites.,renaissance_love
How then? even thus: in Stella's face I read,renaissance_love
What love and beauty be; then all my deed,renaissance_love
"But copying is, what in her Nature writes.",renaissance_love
"With how sad steps, O Moon, thou climb'st the skies!",renaissance_love
"How silently, and with how wan a face!",renaissance_love
"What, may it be that even in heav'nly place",renaissance_love
That busy archer his sharp arrows tries!,renaissance_love
"Sure, if that long-with love-acquainted eyes",renaissance_love
"Can judge of love, thou feel'st a lover's case,",renaissance_love
I read it in thy looks; thy languish'd grace,renaissance_love
"To me, that feel the like, thy state descries.",renaissance_love
"Then, ev'n of fellowship, O Moon, tell me,",renaissance_love
Is constant love deem'd there but want of wit?,renaissance_love
Are beauties there as proud as here they be?,renaissance_love
"Do they above love to be lov'd, and yet",renaissance_love
Those lovers scorn whom that love doth possess?,renaissance_love
Do they call virtue there ungratefulness?,renaissance_love
"I might!unhappy wordO me, I might,",renaissance_love
"And then would not, or could not, see my bliss;",renaissance_love
"Till now wrapt in a most infernal night,",renaissance_love
"I find how heav'nly day, wretch! I did miss.",renaissance_love
"Heart, rend thyself, thou dost thyself but right;",renaissance_love
"No lovely Paris made thy Helen his,",renaissance_love
"No force, no fraud robb'd thee of thy delight,",renaissance_love
Nor Fortune of thy fortune author is;,renaissance_love
"But to myself myself did give the blow,",renaissance_love
"While too much wit, forsooth, so troubled me",renaissance_love
That I respects for both our sakes must show:,renaissance_love
And yet could not by rising morn foresee,renaissance_love
"How fair a day was near: O punish'd eyes,",renaissance_love
"That I had been more foolish,or more wise!Come Sleep! O Sleep, the certain knot of peace,",renaissance_love
"The baiting-place of wit, the balm of woe,",renaissance_love
"The poor man's wealth, the prisoner's release,",renaissance_love
Th' indifferent judge between the high and low.,renaissance_love
With shield of proof shield me from out the prease,renaissance_love
Of those fierce darts despair at me doth throw:,renaissance_love
O make in me those civil wars to cease;,renaissance_love
"I will good tribute pay, if thou do so.",renaissance_love
"Take thou of me smooth pillows, sweetest bed,",renaissance_love
"A chamber deaf to noise and blind to light,",renaissance_love
A rosy garland and a weary head:,renaissance_love
"And if these things, as being thine by right,",renaissance_love
"Move not thy heavy grace, thou shalt in me,",renaissance_love
"Livelier than elsewhere, Stella's image see.",renaissance_love
"Having this day my horse, my hand, my lance",renaissance_love
"Guided so well that I obtain'd the prize,",renaissance_love
Both by the judgment of the English eyes,renaissance_love
And of some sent from that sweet enemy France;,renaissance_love
"Horsemen my skill in horsemanship advance,",renaissance_love
Town folks my strength; a daintier judge applies,renaissance_love
His praise to sleight which from good use doth rise;,renaissance_love
Some lucky wits impute it but to chance;,renaissance_love
"Others, because of both sides I do take",renaissance_love
"My blood from them who did excel in this,",renaissance_love
Think Nature me a man of arms did make.,renaissance_love
"How far they shot awry! The true cause is,",renaissance_love
"Stella look'd on, and from her heav'nly face",renaissance_love
Sent forth the beams which made so fair my race.,renaissance_love
"No more, my dear, no more these counsels try;",renaissance_love
"Oh, give my passions leave to run their race;",renaissance_love
Let Fortune lay on me her worst disgrace;,renaissance_love
Let folk o'ercharg'd with brain against me cry;,renaissance_love
"Let clouds bedim my face, break in mine eye;",renaissance_love
Let me no steps but of lost labour trace;,renaissance_love
"Let all the earth with scorn recount my case,",renaissance_love
But do not will me from my love to fly.,renaissance_love
"I do not envy Aristotle's wit,",renaissance_love
Nor do aspire to Caesar's bleeding fame;,renaissance_love
Nor aught do care though some above me sit;,renaissance_love
"Nor hope nor wish another course to frame,",renaissance_love
But that which once may win thy cruel heart:,renaissance_love
"Thou art my wit, and thou my virtue art.",renaissance_love
"When Nature made her chief work, Stella's eyes,",renaissance_love
In colour black why wrapt she beams so bright?,renaissance_love
"Would she in beamy black, like painter wise,",renaissance_love
"Frame daintiest lustre, mix'd of shades and light?",renaissance_love
"Or did she else that sober hue devise,",renaissance_love
In object best to knit and strength our sight;,renaissance_love
"Lest, if no veil these brave gleams did disguise,",renaissance_love
"They, sunlike, should more dazzle than delight?",renaissance_love
"Or would she her miraculous power show,",renaissance_love
"That, whereas black seems beauty's contrary,",renaissance_love
She even in black doth make all beauties flow?,renaissance_love
"Both so, and thus, she, minding Love should be",renaissance_love
"Plac'd ever there, gave him this mourning weed",renaissance_love
To honour all their deaths who for her bleed.,renaissance_love
Who will in fairest book of nature know,renaissance_love
"How virtue may best lodg'd in beauty be,",renaissance_love
"Let him but learn of love to read in thee,",renaissance_love
"Stella, those fair lines which true goodness show.",renaissance_love
"There shall he find all vices' overthrow,",renaissance_love
"Not by rude force, but sweetest sovereignty",renaissance_love
"Of reason, from whose light those night-birds fly;",renaissance_love
That inward sun in thine eyes shineth so.,renaissance_love
"And, not content to be perfection's heir",renaissance_love
"Thyself, dost strive all minds that way to move,",renaissance_love
Who mark in thee what is in thee most fair.,renaissance_love
"So while thy beauty draws thy heart to love,",renaissance_love
As fast thy virtue bends that love to good:,renaissance_love
"But ""Ah,"" Desire still cries, ""Give me some food!""",renaissance_love
"Highway, since you my chief Parnassus be,",renaissance_love
"And that my Muse, to some ears not unsweet,",renaissance_love
Tempers her words to trampling horses' feet,renaissance_love
More oft than to a chamber melody.,renaissance_love
"Now, blessed you bear onward blessed me",renaissance_love
"To her, where I my heart, safe-left, shall meet:",renaissance_love
My Muse and I must you of duty greet,renaissance_love
"With thanks and wishes, wishing thankfully.",renaissance_love
"Be you still fair, honour'd by public heed;",renaissance_love
"By no encroachment wrong'd, nor time forgot,",renaissance_love
"Nor blam'd for blood, nor sham'd for sinful deed;",renaissance_love
And that you know I envy you no lot,renaissance_love
"Of highest wish, I wish you so much bliss,i",renaissance_love
Hundreds of years you Stella's feet may kiss.,renaissance_love
"Be your words made, good sir, of Indian ware,",renaissance_love
That you allow me them by so small rate?,renaissance_love
Or do you cutted Spartans imitate?,renaissance_love
"Or do you mean my tender ears to spare,",renaissance_love
That to my questions you so total are?,renaissance_love
"When I demand of Phoenix Stella's state,",renaissance_love
"You say, forsooth, you left her well of late:",renaissance_love
"O God, think you that satisfies my care?",renaissance_love
I would know whether she did sit or walk;,renaissance_love
"How cloth'd, how waited on; sigh'd she, or smil'd;",renaissance_love
"Whereof, with whom, how often did she talk;",renaissance_love
With what pastime time's journey she beguiled;,renaissance_love
If her lips deign'd to sweeten my poor name.,renaissance_love
"Say all; and all well said, still say the same.",renaissance_love
Avising the bright beams of these fair eyes,renaissance_love
"Where he is that mine oft moisteth and washeth,",renaissance_love
The wearied mind straight from the heart departeth,renaissance_love
For to rest in his worldly paradise,renaissance_love
And find the sweet bitter under this guise.,renaissance_love
What webs he hath wrought well he perceiveth,renaissance_love
Whereby with himself on love he plaineth,renaissance_love
That spurreth with fire and bridleth with ice.,renaissance_love
"Thus is it in such extremity brought,",renaissance_love
"In frozen thought, now and now it standeth in flame.",renaissance_love
"Twixt misery and wealth, twixt earnest and game,",renaissance_love
"But few glad, and many diverse thought",renaissance_love
With sore repentance of his hardiness.,renaissance_love
Of such a root cometh fruit fruitless.,renaissance_love
"Come live with me, and be my love,",renaissance_love
And we will some new pleasures prove,renaissance_love
"Of golden sands, and crystal brooks,",renaissance_love
"With silken lines, and silver hooks.",renaissance_love
There will the river whispering run,renaissance_love
"Warm'd by thy eyes, more than the sun;",renaissance_love
"And there the 'enamour'd fish will stay,",renaissance_love
Begging themselves they may betray.,renaissance_love
"When thou wilt swim in that live bath,",renaissance_love

"By sun or moon, thou dark'nest both,",renaissance_love
"And if myself have leave to see,",renaissance_love
I need not their light having thee.,renaissance_love
"Let others freeze with angling reeds,",renaissance_love
"And cut their legs with shells and weeds,",renaissance_love
"Or treacherously poor fish beset,",renaissance_love
"With strangling snare, or windowy net.",renaissance_love
Let coarse bold hands from slimy nest,renaissance_love
The bedded fish in banks out-wrest;,renaissance_love
"Or curious traitors, sleeve-silk flies,",renaissance_love
Bewitch poor fishes' wand'ring eyes.,renaissance_love
"For thee, thou need'st no such deceit,",renaissance_love
For thou thyself art thine own bait:,renaissance_love

"Or the king's real, or his stamped face",renaissance_love
"         Contemplate; what you will, approve,",renaissance_love
         So you will let me love.,renaissance_love
"Alas, alas, who's injured by my love?",renaissance_love
         What merchant's ships have my sighs drowned?,renaissance_love
Who says my tears have overflowed his ground?,renaissance_love
         When did my colds a forward spring remove?,renaissance_love
                When did the heats which my veins fill,renaissance_love
                Add one more to the plaguy bill?,renaissance_love
"Soldiers find wars, and lawyers find out still",renaissance_love
"         Litigious men, which quarrels move,",renaissance_love

         And we in us find the eagle and the dove.,renaissance_love
                The phnix riddle hath more wit,renaissance_love
"                By us; we two being one, are it.",renaissance_love
"So, to one neutral thing both sexes fit.",renaissance_love
"         We die and rise the same, and prove",renaissance_love
         Mysterious by this love.,renaissance_love
"We can die by it, if not live by love,",renaissance_love
         And if unfit for tombs and hearse,renaissance_love
"Our legend be, it will be fit for verse;",renaissance_love
"         And if no piece of chronicle we prove,",renaissance_love
                We'll build in sonnets pretty rooms;,renaissance_love
                As well a well-wrought urn becomes,renaissance_love
"The greatest ashes, as half-acre tombs,",renaissance_love
"         And by these hymns, all shall approve",renaissance_love
         Us canonized for Love.,renaissance_love
"And thus invoke us: ""You, whom reverend love",renaissance_love
         Made one another's hermitage;,renaissance_love
"You, to whom love was peace, that now is rage;",renaissance_love
"         Who did the whole world's soul contract, and drove",renaissance_love
                Into the glasses of your eyes,renaissance_love
"                (So made such mirrors, and such spies,",renaissance_love
That they did all to you epitomize),renaissance_love
"         Countries, towns, courts: beg from above",renaissance_love
"         A pattern of your love!""Let it not your wonder move,",renaissance_love
"Less your laughter, that I love.",renaissance_love
"Though I now write fifty years,",renaissance_love
"I have had, and have, my peers;",renaissance_love
"Poets, though divine, are men,",renaissance_love
Some have lov'd as old again.,renaissance_love
"And it is not always face,",renaissance_love
"Clothes, or fortune, gives the grace;",renaissance_love
"Or the feature, or the youth.",renaissance_love
"But the language and the truth,",renaissance_love
"With the ardour and the passion,",renaissance_love
Gives the lover weight and fashion.,renaissance_love
"If you then will read the story,",renaissance_love
First prepare you to be sorry,renaissance_love
That you never knew till now,renaissance_love
Either whom to love or how;,renaissance_love
"But be glad, as soon with me,",renaissance_love
When you know that this is she,renaissance_love
Of whose beauty it was sung;,renaissance_love
"She shall make the old man young,",renaissance_love
"Keep the middle age at stay,",renaissance_love
"And let nothing high decay,",renaissance_love
Till she be the reason why,renaissance_love
All the world for love may die.,renaissance_love
"See the chariot at hand here of Love,",renaissance_love
Wherein my lady rideth!,renaissance_love
"Each that draws is a swan or a dove,",renaissance_love
And well the car Love guideth.,renaissance_love
"As she goes, all hearts do duty",renaissance_love
Unto her beauty;,renaissance_love
"And enamour'd, do wish, so they might",renaissance_love
"But enjoy such a sight,",renaissance_love
"That they still were to run by her side,",renaissance_love
"Through swords, through seas, whither she would ride.",renaissance_love
"Do but look on her eyes, they do light",renaissance_love
All that Love's world compriseth!,renaissance_love
"Do but look on her hair, it is bright",renaissance_love
As Love's star when it riseth!,renaissance_love
"Do but mark, her forehead's smoother",renaissance_love
Than words that soothe her;,renaissance_love
"And from her arched brows, such a grace",renaissance_love
Sheds itself through the face,renaissance_love
As alone there triumphs to the life,renaissance_love
"All the gain, all the good, of the elements' strife.",renaissance_love
"Have you seen but a bright lily grow,",renaissance_love
Before rude hands have touch'd it?,renaissance_love
Ha' you mark'd but the fall o' the snow,renaissance_love
Before the soil hath smutch'd it?,renaissance_love
Ha' you felt the wool o' the beaver?,renaissance_love
Or swan's down ever?,renaissance_love
Or have smelt o' the bud o' the briar?,renaissance_love
Or the nard in the fire?,renaissance_love
Or have tasted the bag of the bee?,renaissance_love
Oh so white! Oh so soft! Oh so sweet is she!,renaissance_love
"Muses that sing love's sensual empery,",renaissance_love
And lovers kindling your enraged fires,renaissance_love
"At Cupid's bonfires burning in the eye,",renaissance_love
Blown with the empty breath of vain desires;,renaissance_love
You that prefer the painted cabinet,renaissance_love
"Before the wealthy jewels it doth store ye,",renaissance_love
"That all your joys in dying figures set,",renaissance_love
And stain the living substance of your glory;,renaissance_love
"Abjure those joys, abhor their memory,",renaissance_love
And let my love the honour'd subject be,renaissance_love
"Of love, and honour's complete history.",renaissance_love
Your eyes were never yet let in to see,renaissance_love
"The majesty and riches of the mind,",renaissance_love
But dwell in darkness; for your god is blind.,renaissance_love
"Dear love, for nothing less than thee",renaissance_love
Would I have broke this happy dream;,renaissance_love
            It was a theme,renaissance_love
"For reason, much too strong for fantasy,",renaissance_love
Therefore thou wak'd'st me wisely; yet,renaissance_love
"My dream thou brok'st not, but continued'st it.",renaissance_love
Thou art so true that thoughts of thee suffice,renaissance_love
"To make dreams truths, and fables histories;",renaissance_love
"Enter these arms, for since thou thought'st it best,",renaissance_love
"Not to dream all my dream, let's act the rest.",renaissance_love
"   As lightning, or a taper's light,",renaissance_love
"Thine eyes, and not thy noise wak'd me;",renaissance_love
            Yet I thought thee,renaissance_love
"(For thou lovest truth) an angel, at first sight;",renaissance_love
"But when I saw thou sawest my heart,",renaissance_love
"And knew'st my thoughts, beyond an angel's art,",renaissance_love
"When thou knew'st what I dreamt, when thou knew'st when",renaissance_love
"Excess of joy would wake me, and cam'st then,",renaissance_love
"I must confess, it could not choose but be",renaissance_love
"Profane, to think thee any thing but thee.",renaissance_love
"   Coming and staying show'd thee, thee,",renaissance_love
"But rising makes me doubt, that now",renaissance_love
            Thou art not thou.,renaissance_love
That love is weak where fear's as strong as he;,renaissance_love
"'Tis not all spirit, pure and brave,",renaissance_love
"If mixture it of fear, shame, honour have;",renaissance_love
"Perchance as torches, which must ready be,",renaissance_love
"Men light and put out, so thou deal'st with me;",renaissance_love
"Thou cam'st to kindle, goest to come; then I",renaissance_love
"Will dream that hope again, but else would die.",renaissance_love
"Where, like a pillow on a bed",renaissance_love
         A pregnant bank swell'd up to rest,renaissance_love
"The violet's reclining head,",renaissance_love
"         Sat we two, one another's best.",renaissance_love
Our hands were firmly cemented,renaissance_love
"         With a fast balm, which thence did spring;",renaissance_love
"Our eye-beams twisted, and did thread",renaissance_love
         Our eyes upon one double string;,renaissance_love
"So to'intergraft our hands, as yet",renaissance_love
"         Was all the means to make us one,",renaissance_love
And pictures in our eyes to get,renaissance_love
         Was all our propagation.,renaissance_love
As 'twixt two equal armies fate,renaissance_love
"         Suspends uncertain victory,",renaissance_love
Our souls (which to advance their state,renaissance_love
         Were gone out) hung 'twixt her and me.,renaissance_love
"And whilst our souls negotiate there,",renaissance_love
         We like sepulchral statues lay;,renaissance_love
"All day, the same our postures were,",renaissance_love
"         And we said nothing, all the day.",renaissance_love
"If any, so by love refin'd",renaissance_love
"         That he soul's language understood,",renaissance_love
"And by good love were grown all mind,",renaissance_love
"         Within convenient distance stood,",renaissance_love
"He (though he knew not which soul spake,",renaissance_love
"         Because both meant, both spake the same)",renaissance_love
Might thence a new concoction take,renaissance_love
         And part far purer than he came.,renaissance_love
"This ecstasy doth unperplex,",renaissance_love
"         We said, and tell us what we love;",renaissance_love
"We see by this it was not sex,",renaissance_love
         We see we saw not what did move;,renaissance_love
But as all several souls contain,renaissance_love
"         Mixture of things, they know not what,",renaissance_love
Love these mix'd souls doth mix again,renaissance_love
"         And makes both one, each this and that.",renaissance_love
"A single violet transplant,",renaissance_love
"         The strength, the colour, and the size,",renaissance_love
(All which before was poor and scant),renaissance_love
"         Redoubles still, and multiplies.",renaissance_love
When love with one another so,renaissance_love
"         Interinanimates two souls,",renaissance_love
"That abler soul, which thence doth flow,",renaissance_love
         Defects of loneliness controls.,renaissance_love
"We then, who are this new soul, know",renaissance_love
"         Of what we are compos'd and made,",renaissance_love
For th' atomies of which we grow,renaissance_love
"         Are souls, whom no change can invade.",renaissance_love
"But oh alas, so long, so far,",renaissance_love
         Our bodies why do we forbear?,renaissance_love
"They'are ours, though they'are not we; we are",renaissance_love
"         The intelligences, they the spheres.",renaissance_love
"We owe them thanks, because they thus",renaissance_love
"         Did us, to us, at first convey,",renaissance_love
"Yielded their senses' force to us,",renaissance_love
"         Nor are dross to us, but allay.",renaissance_love
"On man heaven's influence works not so,",renaissance_love
         But that it first imprints the air;,renaissance_love
"So soul into the soul may flow,",renaissance_love
            Though it to body first repair.,renaissance_love
As our blood labors to beget,renaissance_love
"         Spirits, as like souls as it can,",renaissance_love
Because such fingers need to knit,renaissance_love
"         That subtle knot which makes us man,",renaissance_love
So must pure lovers' souls descend,renaissance_love
"         T' affections, and to faculties,",renaissance_love
"Which sense may reach and apprehend,",renaissance_love
         Else a great prince in prison lies.,renaissance_love
"To'our bodies turn we then, that so",renaissance_love
         Weak men on love reveal'd may look;,renaissance_love
"Love's mysteries in souls do grow,",renaissance_love
         But yet the body is his book.,renaissance_love
"And if some lover, such as we,",renaissance_love
"         Have heard this dialogue of one,",renaissance_love
"Let him still mark us, he shall see",renaissance_love
"         Small change, when we'are to bodies gone.",renaissance_love
         No spring nor summer beauty hath such grace,renaissance_love
         As I have seen in one autumnal face.,renaissance_love
"Young beauties force our love, and that's a rape,",renaissance_love
"         This doth but counsel, yet you cannot scape.",renaissance_love
"If 'twere a shame to love, here 'twere no shame;",renaissance_love
         Affection here takes reverence's name.,renaissance_love
"Were her first years the golden age? That's true,",renaissance_love
         But now she's gold oft tried and ever new.,renaissance_love
"That was her torrid and inflaming time,",renaissance_love
         This is her tolerable tropic clime.,renaissance_love
"Fair eyes, who asks more heat than comes from hence,",renaissance_love
         He in a fever wishes pestilence.,renaissance_love
"Call not these wrinkles, graves; if graves they were,",renaissance_love
"         They were Love's graves, for else he is no where.",renaissance_love
"Yet lies not Love dead here, but here doth sit",renaissance_love
"         Vow'd to this trench, like an anachorit;",renaissance_love
"And here till hers, which must be his death, come,",renaissance_love
"         He doth not dig a grave, but build a tomb.",renaissance_love
Here dwells he; though he sojourn ev'rywhere,renaissance_love
"         In progress, yet his standing house is here:",renaissance_love
"Here where still evening is, not noon nor night,",renaissance_love
"         Where no voluptuousness, yet all delight.",renaissance_love
"In all her words, unto all hearers fit,",renaissance_love
"         You may at revels, you at council, sit.",renaissance_love
"This is Love's timber, youth his underwood;",renaissance_love
"         There he, as wine in June, enrages blood,",renaissance_love
Which then comes seasonabliest when our taste,renaissance_love
         And appetite to other things is past.,renaissance_love
"Xerxes' strange Lydian love, the platan tree,",renaissance_love
"         Was lov'd for age, none being so large as she,",renaissance_love
"Or else because, being young, nature did bless",renaissance_love
"         Her youth with age's glory, barrenness.",renaissance_love
"If we love things long sought, age is a thing",renaissance_love
         Which we are fifty years in compassing;,renaissance_love
"If transitory things, which soon decay,",renaissance_love
         Age must be loveliest at the latest day.,renaissance_love
"But name not winter faces, whose skin's slack,",renaissance_love
"         Lank as an unthrift's purse, but a soul's sack;",renaissance_love
"Whose eyes seek light within, for all here's shade;",renaissance_love
"         Whose mouths are holes, rather worn out than made;",renaissance_love
"Whose every tooth to a several place is gone,",renaissance_love
         To vex their souls at resurrection:,renaissance_love
"Name not these living death's-heads unto me,",renaissance_love
"         For these, not ancient, but antique be.",renaissance_love
"I hate extremes, yet I had rather stay",renaissance_love
"         With tombs than cradles, to wear out a day.",renaissance_love
"Since such love's natural lation is, may still",renaissance_love
"         My love descend, and journey down the hill,",renaissance_love
"Not panting after growing beauties. So,",renaissance_love
         I shall ebb on with them who homeward go.,renaissance_love
         Here take my picture; though I bid farewell,renaissance_love
"Thine, in my heart, where my soul dwells, shall dwell.",renaissance_love
"'Tis like me now, but I dead, 'twill be more",renaissance_love
"When we are shadows both, than 'twas before.",renaissance_love
"When weather-beaten I come back, my hand",renaissance_love
"Perhaps with rude oars torn, or sun beams tann'd,",renaissance_love
"My face and breast of haircloth, and my head",renaissance_love
"With care's rash sudden storms being o'erspread,",renaissance_love
"My body'a sack of bones, broken within,",renaissance_love
And powder's blue stains scatter'd on my skin;,renaissance_love
If rival fools tax thee to'have lov'd a man,renaissance_love
"So foul and coarse as, oh, I may seem then,",renaissance_love
"This shall say what I was, and thou shalt say,",renaissance_love
Do his hurts reach me? doth my worth decay?,renaissance_love
"Or do they reach his judging mind, that he",renaissance_love
"Should now love less, what he did love to see?",renaissance_love
"That which in him was fair and delicate,",renaissance_love
Was but the milk which in love's childish state,renaissance_love
Did nurse it; who now is grown strong enough,renaissance_love
"To feed on that, which to disus'd tastes seems tough.",renaissance_love
Who is it that this dark night Underneath my window plaineth?,renaissance_love
It is one who from thy sight,renaissance_love
"Being, ah, exil'd, disdaineth",renaissance_love
Every other vulgar light.,renaissance_love
"Why, alas, and are you he?
Be not yet those fancies changed?",renaissance_love
"Dear, when you find change in me,",renaissance_love
"Though from me you be estranged,",renaissance_love
Let my change to ruin be.,renaissance_love
"Well, in absence this will die;
Leave to see, and leave to wonder.",renaissance_love
"Absence sure will help, if I",renaissance_love
Can learn how myself to sunder,renaissance_love
From what in my heart doth lie.,renaissance_love
"But time will these thoughts remove;
Time doth work what no man knoweth.",renaissance_love
Time doth as the subject prove;,renaissance_love
With time still the affection groweth,renaissance_love
In the faithful turtle-dove.,renaissance_love
"What if you new beauties see?
Will not they stir new affection?",renaissance_love
"I will think they pictures be,",renaissance_love
"Image-like, of saints' perfection,",renaissance_love
Poorly counterfeiting thee.,renaissance_love
"But your reason's purest light
Bids you leave such minds to nourish.",renaissance_love
"Dear, do reason no such spite;",renaissance_love
Never doth thy beauty flourish,renaissance_love
More than in my reason's sight.,renaissance_love
"But the wrongs love bears will make
Love at length leave undertaking.",renaissance_love
"No, the more fools it do shake,",renaissance_love
In a ground of so firm making,renaissance_love
Deeper still they drive the stake.,renaissance_love
"Peace, I think that some give ear!
Come no more, lest I get anger!",renaissance_love
"Bliss, I will my bliss forbear;",renaissance_love
"Fearing, sweet, you to endanger;",renaissance_love
But my soul shall harbour there.,renaissance_love
"Well, begone; begone, I say,
Lest that Argus' eyes perceive you!",renaissance_love
"Oh, unjust Fortune's sway,",renaissance_love
Which can make me thus to leave you;,renaissance_love
And from louts to run away.,renaissance_love
Farewell love and all thy laws forever;,renaissance_love
Thy baited hooks shall tangle me no more.,renaissance_love
Senec and Plato call me from thy lore,renaissance_love
"To perfect wealth, my wit for to endeavour.",renaissance_love
"In blind error when I did persever,",renaissance_love
"Thy sharp repulse, that pricketh aye so sore,",renaissance_love
Hath taught me to set in trifles no store,renaissance_love
"And scape forth, since liberty is lever.",renaissance_love
Therefore farewell; go trouble younger hearts,renaissance_love
And in me claim no more authority.,renaissance_love
With idle youth go use thy property,renaissance_love
"And thereon spend thy many brittle darts,",renaissance_love
"For hitherto though I have lost all my time,",renaissance_love
Me lusteth no lenger rotten boughs to climb.,renaissance_love
"Follow thy fair sun, unhappy shadow,",renaissance_love
Though thou be black as night,renaissance_love
"And she made all of light,",renaissance_love
Yet follow thy fair sun unhappy shadow.,renaissance_love
"Follow her whose light thy light depriveth,",renaissance_love
"Though here thou livst disgraced,",renaissance_love
"And she in heaven is placed,",renaissance_love
Yet follow her whose light the world reviveth.,renaissance_love
"Follow those pure beams whose beauty burneth,",renaissance_love
"That so have scorched thee,",renaissance_love
"As thou still black must be,",renaissance_love
Till Her kind beams thy black to brightness turneth.,renaissance_love
"Follow her while yet her glory shineth,",renaissance_love
"There comes a luckless night,",renaissance_love
"That will dim all her light,",renaissance_love
And this the black unhappy shade divineth.,renaissance_love
"Follow still since so thy fates ordained,",renaissance_love
"The Sun must have his shade,",renaissance_love
"Till both at once do fade,",renaissance_love
"The Sun still proved, the shadow still disdained.",renaissance_love
"Follow your saint, follow with accents sweet;",renaissance_love
"Haste you, sad notes, fall at her flying feet.",renaissance_love
"There, wrapp'd in cloud of sorrow, pity move,",renaissance_love
And tell the ravisher of my soul I perish for her love:,renaissance_love
"But if she scorns my never-ceasing pain,",renaissance_love
Then burst with sighing in her sight and ne'er return again.,renaissance_love
"All that I sung still to her praise did tend,",renaissance_love
Still she was first; still she my songs did end;,renaissance_love
"Yet she my love and music both doth fly,",renaissance_love
The music that her echo is and beauty's sympathy.,renaissance_love
Then let my notes pursue her scornful flight:,renaissance_love
It shall suffice that they were breath'd and died for her delight.,renaissance_love
Forget not yet the tried intent,renaissance_love
Of such a truth as I have meant;,renaissance_love
"My great travail so gladly spent,",renaissance_love
            Forget not yet.,renaissance_love
   Forget not yet when first began,renaissance_love
"The weary life ye know, since whan",renaissance_love
"The suit, the service, none tell can;",renaissance_love
            Forget not yet.,renaissance_love
"   Forget not yet the great assays,",renaissance_love
"The cruel wrong, the scornful ways;",renaissance_love
"The painful patience in denays,",renaissance_love
            Forget not yet.,renaissance_love
"   Forget not yet, forget not this,",renaissance_love
How long ago hath been and is,renaissance_love
The mind that never meant amiss;,renaissance_love
            Forget not yet.,renaissance_love
"   Forget not then thine own approved,",renaissance_love
"The which so long hath thee so loved,",renaissance_love
Whose steadfast faith yet never moved;,renaissance_love
            Forget not this.,renaissance_love
"            Whoever comes to shroud me, do not harm",renaissance_love
         Nor question much,renaissance_love
"That subtle wreath of hair, which crowns my arm;",renaissance_love
"The mystery, the sign, you must not touch,",renaissance_love
"         For 'tis my outward soul,",renaissance_love
"Viceroy to that, which then to heaven being gone,",renaissance_love
         Will leave this to control,renaissance_love
"And keep these limbs, her provinces, from dissolution.",renaissance_love
For if the sinewy thread my brain lets fall,renaissance_love
         Through every part,renaissance_love
"Can tie those parts, and make me one of all,",renaissance_love
"Those hairs which upward grew, and strength and art",renaissance_love
"         Have from a better brain,",renaissance_love
Can better do'it; except she meant that I,renaissance_love
"         By this should know my pain,",renaissance_love
"As prisoners then are manacled, when they'are condemn'd to die.",renaissance_love
"Whate'er she meant by'it, bury it with me,",renaissance_love
         For since I am,renaissance_love
"Love's martyr, it might breed idolatry,",renaissance_love
If into other hands these relics came;,renaissance_love
         As 'twas humility,renaissance_love
"To afford to it all that a soul can do,",renaissance_love
"         So, 'tis some bravery,",renaissance_love
"That since you would have none of me, I bury some of you.",renaissance_love
"I wonder, by my troth, what thou and I",renaissance_love
"Did, till we loved? Were we not weaned till then?",renaissance_love
"But sucked on country pleasures, childishly?",renaissance_love
Or snorted we in the Seven Sleepers den?,renaissance_love
"Twas so; but this, all pleasures fancies be.",renaissance_love
"If ever any beauty I did see,",renaissance_love
"Which I desired, and got, twas but a dream of thee.",renaissance_love
"And now good-morrow to our waking souls,",renaissance_love
Which watch not one another out of fear;,renaissance_love
"For love, all love of other sights controls,",renaissance_love
And makes one little room an everywhere.,renaissance_love
"Let sea-discoverers to new worlds have gone,",renaissance_love
"Let maps to other, worlds on worlds have shown,",renaissance_love
"Let us possess one world, each hath one, and is one.",renaissance_love
"My face in thine eye, thine in mine appears,",renaissance_love
And true plain hearts do in the faces rest;,renaissance_love
"Where can we find two better hemispheres,",renaissance_love
"Without sharp north, without declining west?",renaissance_love
"Whatever dies, was not mixed equally;",renaissance_love
"If our two loves be one, or, thou and I",renaissance_love
"Love so alike, that none do slacken, none can die.",renaissance_love
The heart and service to you proffer'd,renaissance_love
"With right good will full honestly,",renaissance_love
"Refuse it not, since it is offer'd,",renaissance_love
But take it to you gentlely.,renaissance_love
"And though it be a small present,",renaissance_love
"Yet good, consider graciously",renaissance_love
"The thought, the mind, and the intent",renaissance_love
Of him that loves you faithfully.,renaissance_love
It were a thing of small effect,renaissance_love
"To work my woe thus cruelly,",renaissance_love
For my good will to be abject:,renaissance_love
Therefore accept it lovingly.,renaissance_love
"Pain or travel, to run or ride,",renaissance_love
I undertake it pleasantly;,renaissance_love
"Bid ye me go, and straight I glide",renaissance_love
At your commandement humbly.,renaissance_love
"Pain or pleasure, now may you plant",renaissance_love
Even which it please you steadfastly;,renaissance_love
"Do which you list, I shall not want",renaissance_love
To be your servant secretly.,renaissance_love
And since so much I do desire,renaissance_love
"To be your own assuredly,",renaissance_love
For all my service and my hire,renaissance_love
Reward your servant liberally.,renaissance_love
"On Hellespont, guilty of true love's blood,",renaissance_love
"In view and opposite two cities stood,",renaissance_love
"Sea-borderers, disjoin'd by Neptune's might;",renaissance_love
"The one Abydos, the other Sestos hight.",renaissance_love
"At Sestos Hero dwelt; Hero the fair,",renaissance_love
"Whom young Apollo courted for her hair,",renaissance_love
"And offer'd as a dower his burning throne,",renaissance_love
Where she could sit for men to gaze upon.,renaissance_love
"The outside of her garments were of lawn,",renaissance_love
"The lining purple silk, with gilt stars drawn;",renaissance_love
"Her wide sleeves green, and border'd with a grove,",renaissance_love
Where Venus in her naked glory strove,renaissance_love
To please the careless and disdainful eyes,renaissance_love
"Of proud Adonis, that before her lies;",renaissance_love
"Her kirtle blue, whereon was many a stain,",renaissance_love
Made with the blood of wretched lovers slain.,renaissance_love
"Upon her head she ware a myrtle wreath,",renaissance_love
From whence her veil reach'd to the ground beneath;,renaissance_love
"Her veil was artificial flowers and leaves,",renaissance_love
Whose workmanship both man and beast deceives;,renaissance_love
"Many would praise the sweet smell as she past,",renaissance_love
When 'twas the odour which her breath forth cast;,renaissance_love
"And there for honey bees have sought in vain,",renaissance_love
"And beat from thence, have lighted there again.",renaissance_love
"About her neck hung chains of pebble-stone,",renaissance_love
"Which lighten'd by her neck, like diamonds shone.",renaissance_love
She ware no gloves; for neither sun nor wind,renaissance_love
"Would burn or parch her hands, but, to her mind,",renaissance_love
"Or warm or cool them, for they took delight",renaissance_love
"To play upon those hands, they were so white.",renaissance_love
"Buskins of shells, all silver'd, used she,",renaissance_love
And branch'd with blushing coral to the knee;,renaissance_love
"Where sparrows perch'd, of hollow pearl and gold,",renaissance_love
Such as the world would wonder to behold:,renaissance_love
"Those with sweet water oft her handmaid fills,",renaissance_love
"Which as she went, would chirrup through the bills.",renaissance_love
"Some say, for her the fairest Cupid pin'd,",renaissance_love
"And looking in her face, was strooken blind.",renaissance_love
"But this is true; so like was one the other,",renaissance_love
As he imagin'd Hero was his mother;,renaissance_love
"And oftentimes into her bosom flew,",renaissance_love
"About her naked neck his bare arms threw,",renaissance_love
"And laid his childish head upon her breast,",renaissance_love
And with still panting rock'd there took his rest.,renaissance_love
"So lovely-fair was Hero, Venus' nun,",renaissance_love
"As Nature wept, thinking she was undone,",renaissance_love
"Because she took more from her than she left,",renaissance_love
And of such wondrous beauty her bereft:,renaissance_love
"Therefore, in sign her treasure suffer'd wrack,",renaissance_love
Since Hero's time hath half the world been black.,renaissance_love
"         Amorous Leander, beautiful and young",renaissance_love
"(Whose tragedy divine Musus sung),",renaissance_love
Dwelt at Abydos; since him dwelt there none,renaissance_love
For whom succeeding times make greater moan.,renaissance_love
"His dangling tresses, that were never shorn,",renaissance_love
"Had they been cut, and unto Colchos borne,",renaissance_love
Would have allur'd the vent'rous youth of Greece,renaissance_love
To hazard more than for the golden fleece.,renaissance_love
Fair Cynthia wish'd his arms might be her sphere;,renaissance_love
"Grief makes her pale, because she moves not there.",renaissance_love
His body was as straight as Circe's wand;,renaissance_love
Jove might have sipt out nectar from his hand.,renaissance_love
"Even as delicious meat is to the taste,",renaissance_love
"So was his neck in touching, and surpast",renaissance_love
"The white of Pelops' shoulder: I could tell ye,",renaissance_love
"How smooth his breast was, and how white his belly;",renaissance_love
And whose immortal fingers did imprint,renaissance_love
That heavenly path with many a curious dint,renaissance_love
That runs along his back; but my rude pen,renaissance_love
"Can hardly blazon forth the loves of men,",renaissance_love
Much less of powerful gods: let it suffice,renaissance_love
That my slack Muse sings of Leander's eyes;,renaissance_love
"Those orient cheeks and lips, exceeding his",renaissance_love
That leapt into the water for a kiss,renaissance_love
"Of his own shadow, and, despising many,",renaissance_love
Died ere he could enjoy the love of any.,renaissance_love
"Had wild Hippolytus Leander seen,",renaissance_love
Enamour'd of his beauty had he been.,renaissance_love
"His presence made the rudest peasant melt,",renaissance_love
That in the vast uplandish country dwelt;,renaissance_love
"The barbarous Thracian soldier, mov'd with nought,",renaissance_love
"Was mov'd with him, and for his favour sought.",renaissance_love
"Some swore he was a maid in man's attire,",renaissance_love
"For in his looks were all that men desire,",renaissance_love
"A pleasant smiling cheek, a speaking eye,",renaissance_love
A brow for love to banquet royally;,renaissance_love
"And such as knew he was a man, would say,",renaissance_love
"Leander, thou art made for amorous play;
Why art thou not in love, and lov'd of all?
Though thou be fair, yet be not thine own thrall.",renaissance_love
"         The men of wealthy Sestos every year,",renaissance_love
"For his sake whom their goddess held so dear,",renaissance_love
"Rose-cheek'd Adonis, kept a solemn feast.",renaissance_love
Thither resorted many a wandering guest,renaissance_love
To meet their loves; such as had none at all,renaissance_love
Came lovers home from this great festival;,renaissance_love
"For every street, like to a firmament,",renaissance_love
"Glister'd with breathing stars, who, where they went,",renaissance_love
"Frighted the melancholy earth, which deem'd",renaissance_love
"Eternal heaven to burn, for so it seem'd",renaissance_love
"As if another Pha{""e}ton had got",renaissance_love
The guidance of the sun's rich chariot.,renaissance_love
"But far above the loveliest, Hero shin'd,",renaissance_love
And stole away th' enchanted gazer's mind;,renaissance_love
"For like sea-nymphs' inveigling harmony,",renaissance_love
So was her beauty to the standers-by;,renaissance_love
"Nor that night-wandering, pale, and watery star",renaissance_love
(When yawning dragons draw her thirling car,renaissance_love
"From Latmus' mount up to the gloomy sky,",renaissance_love
"Where, crown'd with blazing light and majesty,",renaissance_love
She proudly sits) more over-rules the flood,renaissance_love
Than she the hearts of those that near her stood.,renaissance_love
"Even as when gaudy nymphs pursue the chase,",renaissance_love
"Wretched Ixion's shaggy-footed race,",renaissance_love
"Incens'd with savage heat, gallop amain",renaissance_love
"From steep pine-bearing mountains to the plain,",renaissance_love
"So ran the people forth to gaze upon her,",renaissance_love
And all that view'd her were enamour'd on her.,renaissance_love
"And as in fury of a dreadful fight,",renaissance_love
"Their fellows being slain or put to flight,",renaissance_love
"Poor soldiers stand with fear of death dead-strooken,",renaissance_love
"So at her presence all surpris'd and tooken,",renaissance_love
Await the sentence of her scornful eyes;,renaissance_love
He whom she favours lives; the other dies.,renaissance_love
"There might you see one sigh, another rage,",renaissance_love
"And some, their violent passions to assuage,",renaissance_love
"Compile sharp satires; but, alas, too late,",renaissance_love
For faithful love will never turn to hate.,renaissance_love
"And many, seeing great princes were denied,",renaissance_love
"Pin'd as they went, and thinking on her, died.",renaissance_love
On this feast-dayO cursed day and hour!,renaissance_love
"Went Hero thorough Sestos, from her tower",renaissance_love
"To Venus' temple, where unhappily,",renaissance_love
"As after chanc'd, they did each other spy.",renaissance_love
So fair a church as this had Venus none:,renaissance_love
"The walls were of discolour'd jasper-stone,",renaissance_love
Wherein was Proteus carved; and over-head,renaissance_love
"A lively vine of green sea-agate spread,",renaissance_love
"Where by one hand light-headed Bacchus hung,",renaissance_love
And with the other wine from grapes out-wrung.,renaissance_love
Of crystal shining fair the pavement was;,renaissance_love
The town of Sestos call'd it Venus' glass:,renaissance_love
"There might you see the gods in sundry shapes,",renaissance_love
"Committing heady riots, incest, rapes:",renaissance_love
"For know, that underneath this radiant flower",renaissance_love
"Was Danae's statue in a brazen tower,",renaissance_love
"Jove slyly stealing from his sister's bed,",renaissance_love
"To dally with Idalian Ganimed,",renaissance_love
"And for his love Europa bellowing loud,",renaissance_love
And tumbling with the rainbow in a cloud;,renaissance_love
"Blood-quaffing Mars heaving the iron net,",renaissance_love
Which limping Vulcan and his Cyclops set;,renaissance_love
"Love kindling fire, to burn such towns as Troy,",renaissance_love
Sylvanus weeping for the lovely boy,renaissance_love
"That now is turn'd into a cypress tree,",renaissance_love
Under whose shade the wood-gods love to be.,renaissance_love
And in the midst a silver altar stood:,renaissance_love
"There Hero, sacrificing turtles' blood,",renaissance_love
"Vail'd to the ground, veiling her eyelids close;",renaissance_love
And modestly they opened as she rose.,renaissance_love
Thence flew Love's arrow with the golden head;,renaissance_love
And thus Leander was enamoured.,renaissance_love
"Stone-still he stood, and evermore he gazed,",renaissance_love
Till with the fire that from his count'nance blazed,renaissance_love
Relenting Hero's gentle heart was strook:,renaissance_love
Such force and virtue hath an amorous look.,renaissance_love
"         It lies not in our power to love or hate,",renaissance_love
For will in us is over-rul'd by fate.,renaissance_love
"When two are stript, long ere the course begin,",renaissance_love
"We wish that one should lose, the other win;",renaissance_love
And one especially do we affect,renaissance_love
"Of two gold ingots, like in each respect:",renaissance_love
"The reason no man knows, let it suffice,",renaissance_love
What we behold is censur'd by our eyes.,renaissance_love
"Where both deliberate, the love is slight:",renaissance_love
"Who ever lov'd, that lov'd not at first sight?",renaissance_love
"Show me dear Christ, thy spouse so bright and clear.",renaissance_love
What! is it she which on the other shore,renaissance_love
"Goes richly painted? or which, robb'd and tore,",renaissance_love
Laments and mourns in Germany and here?,renaissance_love
"Sleeps she a thousand, then peeps up one year?",renaissance_love
"Is she self-truth, and errs? now new, now outwore?",renaissance_love
"Doth she, and did she, and shall she evermore",renaissance_love
"On one, on seven, or on no hill appear?",renaissance_love
"Dwells she with us, or like adventuring knights",renaissance_love
"First travel we to seek, and then make love?",renaissance_love
"Betray, kind husband, thy spouse to our sights,",renaissance_love
"And let mine amorous soul court thy mild Dove,",renaissance_love
Who is most true and pleasing to thee then,renaissance_love
When she'is embrac'd and open to most men.,renaissance_love
Since she whom I lov'd hath paid her last debt,renaissance_love
"To nature, and to hers, and my good is dead,",renaissance_love
"And her soul early into heaven ravished,",renaissance_love
Wholly in heavenly things my mind is set.,renaissance_love
Here the admiring her my mind did whet,renaissance_love
"To seek thee, God; so streams do show the head;",renaissance_love
"But though I have found thee, and thou my thirst hast fed,",renaissance_love
A holy thirsty dropsy melts me yet.,renaissance_love
"But why should I beg more love, whenas thou",renaissance_love
"Dost woo my soul, for hers off'ring all thine,",renaissance_love
And dost not only fear lest I allow,renaissance_love
"My love to saints and angels, things divine,",renaissance_love
But in thy tender jealousy dost doubt,renaissance_love
"Lest the world, flesh, yea devil put thee out.",renaissance_love
"I find no peace, and all my war is done.",renaissance_love
I fear and hope. I burn and freeze like ice.,renaissance_love
"I fly above the wind, yet can I not arise;",renaissance_love
"And nought I have, and all the world I season.",renaissance_love
That loseth nor locketh holdeth me in prison,renaissance_love
And holdeth me notyet can I scape no wise,renaissance_love
"Nor letteth me live nor die at my device,",renaissance_love
And yet of death it giveth me occasion.,renaissance_love
"Without eyen I see, and without tongue I plain.",renaissance_love
"I desire to perish, and yet I ask health.",renaissance_love
"I love another, and thus I hate myself.",renaissance_love
I feed me in sorrow and laugh in all my pain;,renaissance_love
"Likewise displeaseth me both life and death,",renaissance_love
And my delight is causer of this strife.,renaissance_love
"Unhappy verse, the witness of my unhappy state,",renaissance_love
Make thy self flutt'ring wings of thy fast flying,renaissance_love
"Thought, and fly forth unto my love, wheresoever she be:",renaissance_love
"Whether lying restless in heavy bed, or else",renaissance_love
"Sitting so cheerless at the cheerful board, or else",renaissance_love
Playing alone careless on her heavenly virginals.,renaissance_love
"If in bed, tell her, that my eyes can take no rest:",renaissance_love
"If at board, tell her, that my mouth can eat no meat:",renaissance_love
"If at her virginals, tell her, I can hear no mirth.",renaissance_love
Asked why? say: waking love suffereth no sleep:,renaissance_love
Say that raging love doth appal the weak stomach:,renaissance_love
"Say, that lamenting love marreth the musical.",renaissance_love
"Tell her, that her pleasures were wont to lull me asleep:",renaissance_love
"Tell her, that her beauty was wont to feed mine eyes:",renaissance_love
"Tell her, that her sweet tongue was wont to make me mirth.",renaissance_love
"Now do I nightly waste, wanting my kindly rest:",renaissance_love
"Now do I daily starve, wanting my lively food:",renaissance_love
"Now do I always die, wanting thy timely mirth.",renaissance_love
"And if I waste, who will bewail my heavy chance?",renaissance_love
"And if I starve, who will record my cursed end?",renaissance_love
"And if I die, who will say: ""This was Immerito""?",renaissance_love
"I can love both fair and brown,",renaissance_love
"Her whom abundance melts, and her whom want betrays,",renaissance_love
"Her who loves loneness best, and her who masks and plays,",renaissance_love
"Her whom the country formed, and whom the town,",renaissance_love
"Her who believes, and her who tries,",renaissance_love
"Her who still weeps with spongy eyes,",renaissance_love
"And her who is dry cork, and never cries;",renaissance_love
"I can love her, and her, and you, and you,",renaissance_love
"I can love any, so she be not true.",renaissance_love
Will no other vice content you?,renaissance_love
Will it not serve your turn to do as did your mothers?,renaissance_love
"Or have you all old vices spent, and now would find out others?",renaissance_love
Or doth a fear that men are true torment you?,renaissance_love
"O we are not, be not you so;",renaissance_love
"Let me, and do you, twenty know.",renaissance_love
"Rob me, but bind me not, and let me go.",renaissance_love
"Must I, who came to travail thorough you,",renaissance_love
"Grow your fixed subject, because you are true?",renaissance_love
"Venus heard me sigh this song,",renaissance_love
"And by love's sweetest part, variety, she swore,",renaissance_love
She heard not this till now; and that it should be so no more.,renaissance_love
"She went, examined, and returned ere long,",renaissance_love
"And said, Alas! some two or three",renaissance_love
"Poor heretics in love there be,",renaissance_love
Which think to stablish dangerous constancy.,renaissance_love
"But I have told them, Since you will be true,",renaissance_love
You shall be true to them who are false to you.,renaissance_love
"Leave me, O Love, which reachest but to dust;",renaissance_love
"And thou, my mind, aspire to higher things;",renaissance_love
Grow rich in that which never taketh rust;,renaissance_love
Whatever fades but fading pleasure brings.,renaissance_love
Draw in thy beams and humble all thy might,renaissance_love
To that sweet yoke where lasting freedoms be;,renaissance_love
"Which breaks the clouds and opens forth the light,",renaissance_love
That both doth shine and give us sight to see.,renaissance_love
O take fast hold; let that light be thy guide,renaissance_love
"In this small course which birth draws out to death,",renaissance_love
"And think how evil becometh him to slide,",renaissance_love
"Who seeketh heav'n, and comes of heav'nly breath.",renaissance_love
"Then farewell, world; thy uttermost I see:",renaissance_love
"Eternal Love, maintain thy life in me.",renaissance_love
"Stand still, and I will read to thee",renaissance_love
"A lecture, love, in love's philosophy.",renaissance_love
"         These three hours that we have spent,",renaissance_love
"         Walking here, two shadows went",renaissance_love
"Along with us, which we ourselves produc'd.",renaissance_love
"But, now the sun is just above our head,",renaissance_love
"         We do those shadows tread,",renaissance_love
         And to brave clearness all things are reduc'd.,renaissance_love
"So whilst our infant loves did grow,",renaissance_love
"Disguises did, and shadows, flow",renaissance_love
"From us, and our cares; but now 'tis not so.",renaissance_love
"That love has not attain'd the high'st degree,",renaissance_love
Which is still diligent lest others see.,renaissance_love
"Except our loves at this noon stay,",renaissance_love
We shall new shadows make the other way.,renaissance_love
         As the first were made to blind,renaissance_love
"         Others, these which come behind",renaissance_love
"Will work upon ourselves, and blind our eyes.",renaissance_love
"If our loves faint, and westwardly decline,",renaissance_love
"         To me thou, falsely, thine,",renaissance_love
         And I to thee mine actions shall disguise.,renaissance_love
"The morning shadows wear away,",renaissance_love
But these grow longer all the day;,renaissance_love
"But oh, love's day is short, if love decay.",renaissance_love
"Love is a growing, or full constant light,",renaissance_love
"And his first minute, after noon, is night.",renaissance_love
The longe love that in my thought doth harbour,renaissance_love
"And in mine hert doth keep his residence,",renaissance_love
Into my face presseth with bold pretence,renaissance_love
"And therein campeth, spreading his banner.",renaissance_love
She that me learneth to love and suffer,renaissance_love
And will that my trust and lustes negligence,renaissance_love
"Be rayned by reason, shame, and reverence,",renaissance_love
With his hardiness taketh displeasure.,renaissance_love
"Wherewithall unto the hert's forest he fleeth,",renaissance_love
"Leaving his enterprise with pain and cry,",renaissance_love
And there him hideth and not appeareth.,renaissance_love
What may I do when my master feareth,renaissance_love
But in the field with him to live and die?,renaissance_love
For good is the life ending faithfully.,renaissance_love
"Some that have deeper digg'd love's mine than I,",renaissance_love
"Say, where his centric happiness doth lie;",renaissance_love
"         I have lov'd, and got, and told,",renaissance_love
"But should I love, get, tell, till I were old,",renaissance_love
I should not find that hidden mystery.,renaissance_love
"         Oh, 'tis imposture all!",renaissance_love
"And as no chemic yet th'elixir got,",renaissance_love
         But glorifies his pregnant pot,renaissance_love
         If by the way to him befall,renaissance_love
"Some odoriferous thing, or medicinal,",renaissance_love
"         So, lovers dream a rich and long delight,",renaissance_love
         But get a winter-seeming summer's night.,renaissance_love
"Our ease, our thrift, our honour, and our day,",renaissance_love
Shall we for this vain bubble's shadow pay?,renaissance_love
"         Ends love in this, that my man",renaissance_love
"Can be as happy'as I can, if he can",renaissance_love
Endure the short scorn of a bridegroom's play?,renaissance_love
         That loving wretch that swears,renaissance_love
"'Tis not the bodies marry, but the minds,",renaissance_love
"         Which he in her angelic finds,",renaissance_love
"         Would swear as justly that he hears,",renaissance_love
"In that day's rude hoarse minstrelsy, the spheres.",renaissance_love
         Hope not for mind in women; at their best,renaissance_love
"         Sweetness and wit, they'are but mummy, possess'd.",renaissance_love
"         I long to talk with some old lover's ghost,",renaissance_love
      Who died before the god of love was born.,renaissance_love
"I cannot think that he, who then lov'd most,",renaissance_love
      Sunk so low as to love one which did scorn.,renaissance_love
"But since this god produc'd a destiny,",renaissance_love
"And that vice-nature, custom, lets it be,",renaissance_love
"      I must love her, that loves not me.",renaissance_love
"   Sure, they which made him god, meant not so much,",renaissance_love
      Nor he in his young godhead practis'd it.,renaissance_love
"But when an even flame two hearts did touch,",renaissance_love
      His office was indulgently to fit,renaissance_love
Actives to passives. Correspondency,renaissance_love
Only his subject was; it cannot be,renaissance_love
"      Love, till I love her, that loves me.",renaissance_love
   But every modern god will now extend,renaissance_love
      His vast prerogative as far as Jove.,renaissance_love
"To rage, to lust, to write to, to commend,",renaissance_love
      All is the purlieu of the god of love.,renaissance_love
O! were we waken'd by this tyranny,renaissance_love
"To ungod this child again, it could not be",renaissance_love
"      I should love her, who loves not me.",renaissance_love
"   Rebel and atheist too, why murmur I,",renaissance_love
      As though I felt the worst that love could do?,renaissance_love
"Love might make me leave loving, or might try",renaissance_love
"      A deeper plague, to make her love me too;",renaissance_love
"Which, since she loves before, I'am loth to see.",renaissance_love
"Falsehood is worse than hate; and that must be,",renaissance_love
"      If she whom I love, should love me.",renaissance_love
"      If yet I have not all thy love,",renaissance_love
"Dear, I shall never have it all;",renaissance_love
"I cannot breathe one other sigh, to move,",renaissance_love
Nor can intreat one other tear to fall;,renaissance_love
"And all my treasure, which should purchase thee",renaissance_love
"Sighs, tears, and oaths, and lettersI have spent.",renaissance_love
"Yet no more can be due to me,",renaissance_love
Than at the bargain made was meant;,renaissance_love
"If then thy gift of love were partial,",renaissance_love
"That some to me, some should to others fall,",renaissance_love
"         Dear, I shall never have thee all.",renaissance_love
"Or if then thou gavest me all,",renaissance_love
"All was but all, which thou hadst then;",renaissance_love
"But if in thy heart, since, there be or shall",renaissance_love
"New love created be, by other men,",renaissance_love
"Which have their stocks entire, and can in tears,",renaissance_love
"In sighs, in oaths, and letters, outbid me,",renaissance_love
"This new love may beget new fears,",renaissance_love
For this love was not vow'd by thee.,renaissance_love
"And yet it was, thy gift being general;",renaissance_love
"The ground, thy heart, is mine; whatever shall",renaissance_love
"         Grow there, dear, I should have it all.",renaissance_love
"Yet I would not have all yet,",renaissance_love
He that hath all can have no more;,renaissance_love
And since my love doth every day admit,renaissance_love
"New growth, thou shouldst have new rewards in store;",renaissance_love
"Thou canst not every day give me thy heart,",renaissance_love
"If thou canst give it, then thou never gavest it;",renaissance_love
"Love's riddles are, that though thy heart depart,",renaissance_love
"It stays at home, and thou with losing savest it;",renaissance_love
"But we will have a way more liberal,",renaissance_love
"Than changing hearts, to join them; so we shall",renaissance_love
"         Be one, and one another's all.",renaissance_love
"         Madam, withouten many words",renaissance_love
    Once I am sure ye will or no ...,renaissance_love
"And if ye will, then leave your bourds",renaissance_love
"    And use your wit and show it so,",renaissance_love
And with a beck ye shall me call;,renaissance_love
    And if of one that burneth alway,renaissance_love
"Ye have any pity at all,",renaissance_love
    Answer him fair with & {.} or nay.,renaissance_love
"If it be &, {.} I shall be fain;",renaissance_love
"    If it be nay, friends as before;",renaissance_love
"Ye shall another man obtain,",renaissance_love
    And I mine own and yours no more.,renaissance_love
    My lute awake! perform the last,renaissance_love
"Labour that thou and I shall waste,",renaissance_love
And end that I have now begun;,renaissance_love
"For when this song is sung and past,",renaissance_love
"My lute be still, for I have done.",renaissance_love
"As to be heard where ear is none,",renaissance_love
"As lead to grave in marble stone,",renaissance_love
My song may pierce her heart as soon;,renaissance_love
Should we then sigh or sing or moan?,renaissance_love
"No, no, my lute, for I have done.",renaissance_love
The rocks do not so cruelly,renaissance_love
"Repulse the waves continually,",renaissance_love
As she my suit and affection;,renaissance_love
"So that I am past remedy,",renaissance_love
Whereby my lute and I have done.,renaissance_love
Proud of the spoil that thou hast got,renaissance_love
"Of simple hearts thorough Love's shot,",renaissance_love
"By whom, unkind, thou hast them won,",renaissance_love
"Think not he hath his bow forgot,",renaissance_love
Although my lute and I have done.,renaissance_love
Vengeance shall fall on thy disdain,renaissance_love
That makest but game on earnest pain.,renaissance_love
Think not alone under the sun,renaissance_love
"Unquit to cause thy lovers plain,",renaissance_love
Although my lute and I have done.,renaissance_love
Perchance thee lie wethered and old,renaissance_love
"The winter nights that are so cold,",renaissance_love
Plaining in vain unto the moon;,renaissance_love
Thy wishes then dare not be told;,renaissance_love
"Care then who list, for I have done.",renaissance_love
And then may chance thee to repent,renaissance_love
The time that thou hast lost and spent,renaissance_love
To cause thy lovers sigh and swoon;,renaissance_love
"Then shalt thou know beauty but lent,",renaissance_love
And wish and want as I have done.,renaissance_love
"Now cease, my lute; this is the last",renaissance_love
"Labour that thou and I shall waste,",renaissance_love
And ended is that we begun.,renaissance_love
Now is this song both sung and past:,renaissance_love
"My lute be still, for I have done.",renaissance_love
"I now think Love is rather deaf than blind,",renaissance_love
For else it could not be,renaissance_love
"That she,",renaissance_love
"Whom I adore so much, should so slight me",renaissance_love
And cast my love behind.,renaissance_love
"I'm sure my language to her was as sweet,",renaissance_love
And every close did meet,renaissance_love
"In sentence of as subtle feet,",renaissance_love
As hath the youngest He,renaissance_love
That sits in shadow of Apollo's tree.,renaissance_love
"O, but my conscious fears,",renaissance_love
"That fly my thoughts between,",renaissance_love
Tell me that she hath seen,renaissance_love
"My hundred of gray hairs,",renaissance_love
Told seven and forty years,renaissance_love
"Read so much waste, as she cannot embrace",renaissance_love
My mountain belly and my rocky face;,renaissance_love
And all these through her eyes have stopp'd her ears.,renaissance_love
"Come live with me and be my love,",renaissance_love
"And we will all the pleasures prove,",renaissance_love
"That Valleys, groves, hills, and fields,",renaissance_love
"Woods, or steepy mountain yields.",renaissance_love
"And we will sit upon the Rocks,",renaissance_love
"Seeing the Shepherds feed their flocks,",renaissance_love
By shallow Rivers to whose falls,renaissance_love
Melodious birds sing Madrigals.,renaissance_love
And I will make thee beds of Roses,renaissance_love
"And a thousand fragrant posies,",renaissance_love
"A cap of flowers, and a kirtle",renaissance_love
Embroidered all with leaves of Myrtle;,renaissance_love
A gown made of the finest wool,renaissance_love
Which from our pretty Lambs we pull;,renaissance_love
"Fair lined slippers for the cold,",renaissance_love
With buckles of the purest gold;,renaissance_love
"A belt of straw and Ivy buds,",renaissance_love
With Coral clasps and Amber studs:,renaissance_love
"And if these pleasures may thee move,",renaissance_love
"Come live with me, and be my love.",renaissance_love
The Shepherds Swains shall dance and sing,renaissance_love
For thy delight each May-morning:,renaissance_love
"If these delights thy mind may move,",renaissance_love
"Then live with me, and be my love.",renaissance_love
When my grave is broke up again,renaissance_love
"       Some second guest to entertain,",renaissance_love
"       (For graves have learn'd that woman head,",renaissance_love
       To be to more than one a bed),renaissance_love
"                And he that digs it, spies",renaissance_love
"A bracelet of bright hair about the bone,",renaissance_love
"                Will he not let'us alone,",renaissance_love
"And think that there a loving couple lies,",renaissance_love
Who thought that this device might be some way,renaissance_love
"To make their souls, at the last busy day,",renaissance_love
"Meet at this grave, and make a little stay?",renaissance_love
"         If this fall in a time, or land,",renaissance_love
"         Where mis-devotion doth command,",renaissance_love
"         Then he, that digs us up, will bring",renaissance_love
"         Us to the bishop, and the king,",renaissance_love
                To make us relics; then,renaissance_love
"Thou shalt be a Mary Magdalen, and I",renaissance_love
                A something else thereby;,renaissance_love
"All women shall adore us, and some men;",renaissance_love
"And since at such time miracles are sought,",renaissance_love
I would have that age by this paper taught,renaissance_love
What miracles we harmless lovers wrought.,renaissance_love
"         First, we lov'd well and faithfully,",renaissance_love
"         Yet knew not what we lov'd, nor why;",renaissance_love
         Difference of sex no more we knew,renaissance_love
         Than our guardian angels do;,renaissance_love
"                Coming and going, we",renaissance_love
"Perchance might kiss, but not between those meals;",renaissance_love
                Our hands ne'er touch'd the seals,renaissance_love
"Which nature, injur'd by late law, sets free;",renaissance_love
"These miracles we did, but now alas,",renaissance_love
"All measure, and all language, I should pass,",renaissance_love
Should I tell what a miracle she was.,renaissance_love
"Ring out your bells, let mourning shows be spread;",renaissance_love
For Love is dead,renaissance_love
"All love is dead, infected",renaissance_love
With plague of deep disdain;,renaissance_love
"Worth, as nought worth, rejected,",renaissance_love
And Faith fair scorn doth gain.,renaissance_love
"From so ungrateful fancy,",renaissance_love
"From such a female franzy,",renaissance_love
"From them that use men thus,",renaissance_love
"Good Lord, deliver us!",renaissance_love
"Weep, neighbours, weep; do you not hear it said",renaissance_love
That Love is dead?,renaissance_love
"His death-bed, peacock's folly;",renaissance_love
His winding-sheet is shame;,renaissance_love
"His will, false-seeming holy;",renaissance_love
"His sole exec'tor, blame.",renaissance_love
"From so ungrateful fancy,",renaissance_love
"From such a female franzy,",renaissance_love
"From them that use men thus,",renaissance_love
"Good Lord, deliver us!",renaissance_love
"Let dirge be sung and trentals rightly read,",renaissance_love
For Love is dead;,renaissance_love
Sir Wrong his tomb ordaineth,renaissance_love
"My mistress' marble heart,",renaissance_love
"Which epitaph containeth,",renaissance_love
Her eyes were once his dart.,renaissance_love
"From so ungrateful fancy,",renaissance_love
"From such a female franzy,",renaissance_love
"From them that use men thus,",renaissance_love
"Good Lord, deliver us!",renaissance_love
"Alas, I lie, rage hath this error bred;",renaissance_love
Love is not dead;,renaissance_love
"Love is not dead, but sleepeth",renaissance_love
"In her unmatched mind,",renaissance_love
"Where she his counsel keepeth,",renaissance_love
Till due desert she find.,renaissance_love
"Therefore from so vile fancy,",renaissance_love
"To call such wit a franzy,",renaissance_love
"Who Love can temper thus,",renaissance_love
"Good Lord, deliver us!Rose-cheek'd Laura, come,",renaissance_love
Sing thou smoothly with thy beauty's,renaissance_love
"Silent music, either other",renaissance_love
Sweetly gracing.,renaissance_love
Lovely forms do flow,renaissance_love
From concent divinely framed;,renaissance_love
"Heav'n is music, and thy beauty's",renaissance_love
Birth is heavenly.,renaissance_love
These dull notes we sing,renaissance_love
Discords need for helps to grace them;,renaissance_love
Only beauty purely loving,renaissance_love
"Knows no discord,",renaissance_love
"But still moves delight,",renaissance_love
"Like clear springs renew'd by flowing,",renaissance_love
"Ever perfect, ever in them-",renaissance_love
"Selves eternal.Since so ye please to hear me plain,",renaissance_love
"And that ye do rejoice my smart,",renaissance_love
Me list no lenger to remain,renaissance_love
To such as be so overthwart.,renaissance_love
But cursed be that cruel heart,renaissance_love
Which hath procurd a careless mind,renaissance_love
"For me and mine unfeigned smart,",renaissance_love
And forceth me such faults to find.,renaissance_love
More than too much I am assured,renaissance_love
"Of thine intent, whereto to trust;",renaissance_love
"A speedless proof I have endured,",renaissance_love
And now I leave it to them that lust.,renaissance_love
"My true-love hath my heart and I have his,",renaissance_love
By just exchange one for the other given:,renaissance_love
"I hold his dear, and mine he cannot miss;",renaissance_love
There never was a bargain better driven.,renaissance_love
His heart in me keeps me and him in one;,renaissance_love
My heart in him his thoughts and senses guides:,renaissance_love
"He loves my heart, for once it was his own;",renaissance_love
I cherish his because in me it bides.,renaissance_love
His heart his wound received from my sight;,renaissance_love
My heart was wounded with his wounded heart;,renaissance_love
"For as from me on him his hurt did light,",renaissance_love
"So still, methought, in me his hurt did smart:",renaissance_love
"Both equal hurt, in this change sought our bliss,",renaissance_love
My true love hath my heart and I have his.,renaissance_love
"Go and catch a falling star,",renaissance_love
"    Get with child a mandrake root,",renaissance_love
"Tell me where all past years are,",renaissance_love
"    Or who cleft the devil's foot,",renaissance_love
"Teach me to hear mermaids singing,",renaissance_love
"Or to keep off envy's stinging,",renaissance_love
            And find,renaissance_love
            What wind,renaissance_love
Serves to advance an honest mind.,renaissance_love
"If thou be'st born to strange sights,",renaissance_love
"    Things invisible to see,",renaissance_love
"Ride ten thousand days and nights,",renaissance_love
"    Till age snow white hairs on thee,",renaissance_love
"Thou, when thou return'st, wilt tell me,",renaissance_love
"All strange wonders that befell thee,",renaissance_love
"            And swear,",renaissance_love
            No where,renaissance_love
"Lives a woman true, and fair.",renaissance_love
"If thou find'st one, let me know,",renaissance_love
    Such a pilgrimage were sweet;,renaissance_love
"Yet do not, I would not go,",renaissance_love
    Though at next door we might meet;,renaissance_love
"Though she were true, when you met her,",renaissance_love
"And last, till you write your letter,",renaissance_love
            Yet she,renaissance_love
            Will be,renaissance_love
"False, ere I come, to two, or three.",renaissance_love
The student may give either title during the recitation.,renaissance_love
O Mistress mine where are you roaming?,renaissance_love
"O stay and hear, your true love's coming,",renaissance_love
      That can sing both high and low.,renaissance_love
Trip no further pretty sweeting.,renaissance_love
"Journeys end in lovers' meeting,",renaissance_love
      Every wise man's son doth know.,renaissance_love
"What is love, 'tis not hereafter,",renaissance_love
"Present mirth, hath present laughter:",renaissance_love
"      What's to come, is still unsure.",renaissance_love
"In delay there lies no plenty,",renaissance_love
Then come kiss me sweet and twenty:,renaissance_love
      Youth's a stuff will not endure.,renaissance_love
"      Sweetest love, I do not go,",renaissance_love
"         For weariness of thee,",renaissance_love
Nor in hope the world can show,renaissance_love
         A fitter love for me;,renaissance_love
                But since that I,renaissance_love
"Must die at last, 'tis best",renaissance_love
To use myself in jest,renaissance_love
         Thus by feign'd deaths to die.,renaissance_love
"Yesternight the sun went hence,",renaissance_love
         And yet is here today;,renaissance_love
"He hath no desire nor sense,",renaissance_love
         Nor half so short a way:,renaissance_love
"                Then fear not me,",renaissance_love
But believe that I shall make,renaissance_love
"Speedier journeys, since I take",renaissance_love
         More wings and spurs than he.,renaissance_love
"O how feeble is man's power,",renaissance_love
"         That if good fortune fall,",renaissance_love
"Cannot add another hour,",renaissance_love
         Nor a lost hour recall!,renaissance_love
"                But come bad chance,",renaissance_love
"And we join to'it our strength,",renaissance_love
"And we teach it art and length,",renaissance_love
         Itself o'er us to'advance.,renaissance_love
"When thou sigh'st, thou sigh'st not wind,",renaissance_love
         But sigh'st my soul away;,renaissance_love
"When thou weep'st, unkindly kind,",renaissance_love
         My life's blood doth decay.,renaissance_love
                It cannot be,renaissance_love
"That thou lov'st me, as thou say'st,",renaissance_love
"If in thine my life thou waste,",renaissance_love
         That art the best of me.,renaissance_love
Let not thy divining heart,renaissance_love
         Forethink me any ill;,renaissance_love
"Destiny may take thy part,",renaissance_love
         And may thy fears fulfil;,renaissance_love
                But think that we,renaissance_love
Are but turn'd aside to sleep;,renaissance_love
They who one another keep,renaissance_love
"         Alive, ne'er parted be.",renaissance_love
"         Take, oh take those lips away,",renaissance_love
"      That so sweetly were forsworn,",renaissance_love
"And those eyes: the breake of day,",renaissance_love
      Lights that do mislead the Morn;,renaissance_love
"But my kisses bring again, bring again,",renaissance_love
"Seals of love, but sealed in vain, sealed in vain.",renaissance_love
"Drink to me only with thine eyes,",renaissance_love
         And I will pledge with mine;,renaissance_love
"Or leave a kiss but in the cup,",renaissance_love
         And Ill not look for wine.,renaissance_love
The thirst that from the soul doth rise,renaissance_love
         Doth ask a drink divine;,renaissance_love
"But might I of Joves nectar sup,",renaissance_love
         I would not change for thine.,renaissance_love
"I sent thee late a rosy wreath,",renaissance_love
         Not so much honouring thee,renaissance_love
"As giving it a hope, that there",renaissance_love
         It could not withered be.,renaissance_love
"But thou thereon didst only breathe,",renaissance_love
         And sentst it back to me;,renaissance_love
"Since when it grows, and smells, I swear,",renaissance_love
"         Not of itself, but thee.",renaissance_love
         When I consider everything that grows,renaissance_love
"Holds in perfection but a little moment,",renaissance_love
That this huge stage presenteth nought but shows,renaissance_love
Whereon the stars in secret influence comment;,renaissance_love
"When I perceive that men as plants increase,",renaissance_love
"Cheered and check'd even by the selfsame sky,",renaissance_love
"Vaunt in their youthful sap, at height decrease,",renaissance_love
And wear their brave state out of memory;,renaissance_love
Then the conceit of this inconstant stay,renaissance_love
"Sets you most rich in youth before my sight,",renaissance_love
Where wasteful Time debateth with Decay,renaissance_love
To change your day of youth to sullied night;,renaissance_love
"And all in war with Time for love of you,",renaissance_love
"As he takes from you, I engraft you new.",renaissance_love
"Devouring Time, blunt thou the lion's paws,",renaissance_love
And make the earth devour her own sweet brood;,renaissance_love
"Pluck the keen teeth from the fierce tiger's jaws,",renaissance_love
And burn the long-liv'd Phoenix in her blood;,renaissance_love
"Make glad and sorry seasons as thou fleets,",renaissance_love
"And do whate'er thou wilt, swift-footed Time,",renaissance_love
To the wide world and all her fading sweets;,renaissance_love
But I forbid thee one more heinous crime:,renaissance_love
"O, carve not with the hours my love's fair brow,",renaissance_love
Nor draw no lines there with thine antique pen!,renaissance_love
Him in thy course untainted do allow,renaissance_love
For beauty's pattern to succeeding men.,renaissance_love
"Yet do thy worst, old Time! Despite thy wrong",renaissance_love
My love shall in my verse ever live young.,renaissance_love
Let those who are in favour with their stars,renaissance_love
"Of public honour and proud titles boast,",renaissance_love
"Whilst I, whom fortune of such triumph bars,",renaissance_love
Unlook'd for joy in that I honour most.,renaissance_love
Great princes' favourites their fair leaves spread,renaissance_love
"But as the marigold at the sun's eye,",renaissance_love
"And in themselves their pride lies buried,",renaissance_love
For at a frown they in their glory die.,renaissance_love
"The painful warrior famoused for fight,",renaissance_love
"After a thousand victories once foil'd,",renaissance_love
"Is from the book of honour razed quite,",renaissance_love
And all the rest forgot for which he toil'd:,renaissance_love
"Then happy I, that love and am beloved",renaissance_love
Where I may not remove nor be removed.,renaissance_love
"When, in disgrace with fortune and mens eyes,",renaissance_love
"I all alone beweep my outcast state,",renaissance_love
"And trouble deaf heaven with my bootless cries,",renaissance_love
"And look upon myself and curse my fate,",renaissance_love
"Wishing me like to one more rich in hope,",renaissance_love
"Featured like him, like him with friends possessed,",renaissance_love
"Desiring this mans art and that mans scope,",renaissance_love
With what I most enjoy contented least;,renaissance_love
"Yet in these thoughts myself almost despising,",renaissance_love
"Haply I think on thee, and then my state,",renaissance_love
(Like to the lark at break of day arising,renaissance_love
From sullen earth) sings hymns at heavens gate;,renaissance_love
       For thy sweet love remembered such wealth brings,renaissance_love
       That then I scorn to change my state with kings.,renaissance_love
       When to the sessions of sweet silent thought,renaissance_love
"I summon up remembrance of things past,",renaissance_love
"I sigh the lack of many a thing I sought,",renaissance_love
And with old woes new wail my dear time's waste:,renaissance_love
"Then can I drown an eye, unus'd to flow,",renaissance_love
"For precious friends hid in death's dateless night,",renaissance_love
"And weep afresh love's long since cancell'd woe,",renaissance_love
And moan th' expense of many a vanish'd sight;,renaissance_love
"Then can I grieve at grievances foregone,",renaissance_love
And heavily from woe to woe tell o'er,renaissance_love
"The sad account of fore-bemoaned moan,",renaissance_love
Which I new pay as if not paid before.,renaissance_love
"But if the while I think on thee, dear friend,",renaissance_love
"All losses are restor'd, and sorrows end.",renaissance_love
"If thou survive my well-contented day,",renaissance_love
"When that churl Death my bones with dust shall cover,",renaissance_love
And shalt by fortune once more re-survey,renaissance_love
"These poor rude lines of thy deceased lover,",renaissance_love
"Compare them with the bettering of the time,",renaissance_love
"And though they be outstripp'd by every pen,",renaissance_love
"Reserve them for my love, not for their rhyme,",renaissance_love
Exceeded by the height of happier men.,renaissance_love
O then vouchsafe me but this loving thought:,renaissance_love
"Had my friend's Muse grown with this growing age
A dearer birth than this his love had brought,
To march in ranks of better equipage:
But since he died and poets better prove,
Theirs for their style I'll read, his for his love.",renaissance_love
Full many a glorious morning have I seen,renaissance_love
"Flatter the mountain-tops with sovereign eye,",renaissance_love
"Kissing with golden face the meadows green,",renaissance_love
Gilding pale streams with heavenly alchemy;,renaissance_love
Anon permit the basest clouds to ride,renaissance_love
With ugly rack on his celestial face,renaissance_love
"And from the forlorn world his visage hide,",renaissance_love
Stealing unseen to west with this disgrace.,renaissance_love
Even so my sun one early morn did shine,renaissance_love
With all-triumphant splendour on my brow;,renaissance_love
"But out, alack! he was but one hour mine;",renaissance_love
The region cloud hath mask'd him from me now.,renaissance_love
Yet him for this my love no whit disdaineth;,renaissance_love
Suns of the world may stain when heaven's sun staineth.,renaissance_love
"What is your substance, whereof are you made,",renaissance_love
That millions of strange shadows on you tend?,renaissance_love
"Since every one hath, every one, one shade,",renaissance_love
"And you, but one, can every shadow lend.",renaissance_love
"Describe Adonis, and the counterfeit",renaissance_love
Is poorly imitated after you;,renaissance_love
"On Helen's cheek all art of beauty set,",renaissance_love
And you in Grecian tires are painted new.,renaissance_love
Speak of the spring and foison of the year:,renaissance_love
"The one doth shadow of your beauty show,",renaissance_love
The other as your bounty doth appear;,renaissance_love
And you in every blessed shape we know.,renaissance_love
"    In all external grace you have some part,",renaissance_love
"    But you like none, none you, for constant heart.",renaissance_love
    When I have seen by Time's fell hand defac'd,renaissance_love
The rich proud cost of outworn buried age;,renaissance_love
When sometime lofty towers I see down-ras'd,renaissance_love
And brass eternal slave to mortal rage;,renaissance_love
When I have seen the hungry ocean gain,renaissance_love
"Advantage on the kingdom of the shore,",renaissance_love
"And the firm soil win of the wat'ry main,",renaissance_love
Increasing store with loss and loss with store;,renaissance_love
"When I have seen such interchange of state,",renaissance_love
Or state itself confounded to decay;,renaissance_love
"Ruin hath taught me thus to ruminate,",renaissance_love
That Time will come and take my love away.,renaissance_love
"This thought is as a death, which cannot choose",renaissance_love
But weep to have that which it fears to lose.,renaissance_love
"Tir'd with all these, for restful death I cry,",renaissance_love
"As, to behold desert a beggar born,",renaissance_love
"And needy nothing trimm'd in jollity,",renaissance_love
"And purest faith unhappily forsworn,",renaissance_love
"And gilded honour shamefully misplac'd,",renaissance_love
"And maiden virtue rudely strumpeted,",renaissance_love
"And right perfection wrongfully disgrac'd,",renaissance_love
"And strength by limping sway disabled,",renaissance_love
"And art made tongue-tied by authority,",renaissance_love
"And folly, doctor-like, controlling skill,",renaissance_love
"And simple truth miscall'd simplicity,",renaissance_love
And captive good attending captain ill.,renaissance_love
"Tir'd with all these, from these would I be gone,",renaissance_love
"Save that, to die, I leave my love alone.",renaissance_love
No longer mourn for me when I am dead,renaissance_love
Than you shall hear the surly sullen bell,renaissance_love
Give warning to the world that I am fled,renaissance_love
From this vile world with vilest worms to dwell; ,renaissance_love
"Nay, if you read this line, remember not",renaissance_love
"The hand that writ it; for I love you so, ",renaissance_love
"That I in your sweet thoughts would be forgot, ",renaissance_love
If thinking on me then should make you woe.,renaissance_love
"O, if (I say) you look upon this verse, ",renaissance_love
"When I (perhaps) compounded am with clay,",renaissance_love
"Do not so much as my poor name rehearse,",renaissance_love
"But let your love even with my life decay,",renaissance_love
"Lest the wise world should look into your moan, ",renaissance_love
And mock you with me after I am gone.,renaissance_love
That time of year thou mayst in me behold,renaissance_love
"When yellow leaves, or none, or few, do hang",renaissance_love
"Upon those boughs which shake against the cold,",renaissance_love
"Bare ruin'd choirs, where late the sweet birds sang.",renaissance_love
In me thou see'st the twilight of such day,renaissance_love
"As after sunset fadeth in the west,",renaissance_love
"Which by and by black night doth take away,",renaissance_love
"Death's second self, that seals up all in rest.",renaissance_love
In me thou see'st the glowing of such fire,renaissance_love
"That on the ashes of his youth doth lie,",renaissance_love
"As the death-bed whereon it must expire,",renaissance_love
Consum'd with that which it was nourish'd by.,renaissance_love
"This thou perceiv'st, which makes thy love more strong,",renaissance_love
To love that well which thou must leave ere long.,renaissance_love
"Not mine own fears, nor the prophetic soul",renaissance_love
"Of the wide world dreaming on things to come,",renaissance_love
"Can yet the lease of my true love control,",renaissance_love
Suppos'd as forfeit to a confin'd doom.,renaissance_love
The mortal moon hath her eclipse endur'd,renaissance_love
And the sad augurs mock their own presage;,renaissance_love
Incertainties now crown themselves assur'd,renaissance_love
And peace proclaims olives of endless age.,renaissance_love
Now with the drops of this most balmy time,renaissance_love
"My love looks fresh, and Death to me subscribes,",renaissance_love
"Since, spite of him, I'll live in this poor rhyme,",renaissance_love
While he insults o'er dull and speechless tribes;,renaissance_love
"And thou in this shalt find thy monument,",renaissance_love
When tyrants' crests and tombs of brass are spent.,renaissance_love
"Alas, 'tis true I have gone here and there",renaissance_love
"And made myself a motley to the view,",renaissance_love
"Gor'd mine own thoughts, sold cheap what is most dear,",renaissance_love
Made old offences of affections new.,renaissance_love
Most true it is that I have look'd on truth,renaissance_love
"Askance and strangely: but, by all above,",renaissance_love
"These blenches gave my heart another youth,",renaissance_love
And worse essays prov'd thee my best of love.,renaissance_love
"Now all is done, have what shall have no end!",renaissance_love
"Mine appetite, I never more will grind",renaissance_love
"On newer proof, to try an older friend,",renaissance_love
"A god in love, to whom I am confin'd.",renaissance_love
"Then give me welcome, next my heaven the best,",renaissance_love
Even to thy pure and most most loving breast.,renaissance_love
Let me not to the marriage of true minds,renaissance_love
Admit impediments. Love is not love,renaissance_love
"Which alters when it alteration finds,",renaissance_love
Or bends with the remover to remove.,renaissance_love
O no! it is an ever-fixed mark,renaissance_love
That looks on tempests and is never shaken;,renaissance_love
"It is the star to every wand'ring bark,",renaissance_love
"Whose worth's unknown, although his height be taken.",renaissance_love
"Love's not Time's fool, though rosy lips and cheeks",renaissance_love
Within his bending sickle's compass come;,renaissance_love
"Love alters not with his brief hours and weeks,",renaissance_love
But bears it out even to the edge of doom.,renaissance_love
"If this be error and upon me prov'd,",renaissance_love
"I never writ, nor no man ever lov'd.",renaissance_love
Th' expense of spirit in a waste of shame,renaissance_love
"Is lust in action; and till action, lust",renaissance_love
"Is perjured, murd'rous, bloody, full of blame,",renaissance_love
"Savage, extreme, rude, cruel, not to trust,",renaissance_love
"Enjoyed no sooner but despised straight,",renaissance_love
"Past reason hunted; and, no sooner had",renaissance_love
Past reason hated as a swallowed bait,renaissance_love
On purpose laid to make the taker mad;,renaissance_love
"Mad in pursuit and in possession so,",renaissance_love
"Had, having, and in quest to have, extreme;",renaissance_love
"A bliss in proof and proved, a very woe;",renaissance_love
"Before, a joy proposed; behind, a dream.",renaissance_love
    All this the world well knows; yet none knows well,renaissance_love
    To shun the heaven that leads men to this hell.,renaissance_love
    My mistress' eyes are nothing like the sun;,renaissance_love
Coral is far more red than her lips' red;,renaissance_love
"If snow be white, why then her breasts are dun;",renaissance_love
"If hairs be wires, black wires grow on her head.",renaissance_love
"I have seen roses damasked, red and white,",renaissance_love
But no such roses see I in her cheeks;,renaissance_love
And in some perfumes is there more delight,renaissance_love
Than in the breath that from my mistress reeks.,renaissance_love
"I love to hear her speak, yet well I know",renaissance_love
That music hath a far more pleasing sound;,renaissance_love
I grant I never saw a goddess go;,renaissance_love
"My mistress, when she walks, treads on the ground.",renaissance_love
"   And yet, by heaven, I think my love as rare",renaissance_love
   As any she belied with false compare.,renaissance_love
"   Poor soul, the centre of my sinful earth,",renaissance_love
"[......] these rebel powers that thee array,",renaissance_love
"Why dost thou pine within and suffer dearth,",renaissance_love
Painting thy outward walls so costly gay?,renaissance_love
"Why so large cost, having so short a lease,",renaissance_love
Dost thou upon thy fading mansion spend?,renaissance_love
"Shall worms, inheritors of this excess,",renaissance_love
Eat up thy charge? Is this thy body's end?,renaissance_love
"Then soul, live thou upon thy servant's loss",renaissance_love
And let that pine to aggravate thy store;,renaissance_love
Buy terms divine in selling hours of dross;,renaissance_love
"Within be fed, without be rich no more.",renaissance_love
"So shalt thou feed on Death, that feeds on men,",renaissance_love
"And, Death once dead, there's no more dying then.",renaissance_love
"Still to be neat, still to be dressed,",renaissance_love
As you were going to a feast;,renaissance_love
"Still to be powdered, still perfumed; ",renaissance_love
"Lady, it is to be presumed,",renaissance_love
"Though art's hid causes are not found,",renaissance_love
"All is not sweet, all is not sound.",renaissance_love
"Give me a look, give me a face,",renaissance_love
That makes simplicity a grace;,renaissance_love
"Robes loosely flowing, hair as free;",renaissance_love
Such sweet neglect more taketh me,renaissance_love
                       Than all th'adulteries of art. ,renaissance_love
"They strike mine eyes, but not my heart.",renaissance_love
"Busy old fool, unruly sun,",renaissance_love
"               Why dost thou thus,",renaissance_love
"Through windows, and through curtains call on us?",renaissance_love
Must to thy motions lovers' seasons run?,renaissance_love
"               Saucy pedantic wretch, go chide",renaissance_love
"               Late school boys and sour prentices,",renaissance_love
"         Go tell court huntsmen that the king will ride,",renaissance_love
"         Call country ants to harvest offices,",renaissance_love
"Love, all alike, no season knows nor clime,",renaissance_love
"Nor hours, days, months, which are the rags of time.",renaissance_love
"               Thy beams, so reverend and strong",renaissance_love
               Why shouldst thou think?,renaissance_love
"I could eclipse and cloud them with a wink,",renaissance_love
But that I would not lose her sight so long;,renaissance_love
"               If her eyes have not blinded thine,",renaissance_love
"               Look, and tomorrow late, tell me,",renaissance_love
         Whether both th' Indias of spice and mine,renaissance_love
"         Be where thou leftst them, or lie here with me.",renaissance_love
"Ask for those kings whom thou saw'st yesterday,",renaissance_love
"And thou shalt hear, All here in one bed lay.",renaissance_love
"               She's all states, and all princes, I,",renaissance_love
               Nothing else is.,renaissance_love
"Princes do but play us; compared to this,",renaissance_love
"All honor's mimic, all wealth alchemy.",renaissance_love
"               Thou, sun, art half as happy as we,",renaissance_love
               In that the world's contracted thus.,renaissance_love
"         Thine age asks ease, and since thy duties be",renaissance_love
"         To warm the world, that's done in warming us.",renaissance_love
"Shine here to us, and thou art everywhere;",renaissance_love
"This bed thy center is, these walls, thy sphere.",renaissance_love
There is a garden in her face,renaissance_love
Where roses and white lilies grow;,renaissance_love
A heav'nly paradise is that place,renaissance_love
Wherein all pleasant fruits do flow.,renaissance_love
"There cherries grow which none may buy,",renaissance_love
"Till ""Cherry ripe"" themselves do cry.",renaissance_love
Those cherries fairly do enclose,renaissance_love
"Of orient pearl a double row,",renaissance_love
"Which when her lovely laughter shows,",renaissance_love
They look like rose-buds fill'd with snow;,renaissance_love
"Yet them nor peer nor prince can buy,",renaissance_love
"Till ""Cherry ripe"" themselves do cry.",renaissance_love
"Her eyes like angels watch them still,",renaissance_love
"Her brows like bended bows do stand,",renaissance_love
Threat'ning with piercing frowns to kill,renaissance_love
All that attempt with eye or hand,renaissance_love
"Those sacred cherries to come nigh,",renaissance_love
"Till ""Cherry ripe"" themselves do cry.",renaissance_love
They flee from me that sometime did me seek,renaissance_love
"With naked foot, stalking in my chamber.",renaissance_love
"I have seen them gentle, tame, and meek,",renaissance_love
That now are wild and do not remember,renaissance_love
That sometime they put themself in danger,renaissance_love
"To take bread at my hand; and now they range,",renaissance_love
Busily seeking with a continual change.,renaissance_love
Thanked be fortune it hath been otherwise,renaissance_love
"Twenty times better; but once in special,",renaissance_love
"In thin array after a pleasant guise,",renaissance_love
"When her loose gown from her shoulders did fall,",renaissance_love
And she me caught in her arms long and small;,renaissance_love
Therewithall sweetly did me kiss,renaissance_love
"And softly said, Dear heart, how like you this?",renaissance_love
It was no dream: I lay broad waking.,renaissance_love
But all is turned thorough my gentleness,renaissance_love
Into a strange fashion of forsaking;,renaissance_love
"And I have leave to go of her goodness,",renaissance_love
"And she also, to use newfangleness.",renaissance_love
But since that I so kindly am served,renaissance_love
I would fain know what she hath deserved.,renaissance_love
"Thrice toss these oaken ashes in the air,",renaissance_love
"Thrice sit thou mute in this enchanted chair,",renaissance_love
"Then thrice three times tie up this true love's knot,",renaissance_love
"And murmur soft ""She will, or she will not.""",renaissance_love
"Go burn these pois'nous weeds in yon blue fire,",renaissance_love
"These screech-owl's feathers and this prickling briar,",renaissance_love
"This cypress gathered at a dead man's grave,",renaissance_love
That all my fears and cares an end may have.,renaissance_love
"Then come, you fairies! dance with me a round;",renaissance_love
Melt her hard heart with your melodious sound.,renaissance_love
In vain are all the charms I can devise:,renaissance_love
She hath an art to break them with her eyes.,renaissance_love
"Unstable dream, according to the place,",renaissance_love
"Be steadfast once, or else at least be true.",renaissance_love
By tasted sweetness make me not to rue,renaissance_love
The sudden loss of thy false feigned grace.,renaissance_love
By good respect in such a dangerous case,renaissance_love
Thou broughtest not her into this tossing mew,renaissance_love
"But madest my sprite live, my care to renew,",renaissance_love
My body in tempest her succour to embrace.,renaissance_love
"The body dead, the sprite had his desire,",renaissance_love
"Painless was th'one, th'other in delight.",renaissance_love
"Why then, alas, did it not keep it right,",renaissance_love
"Returning, to leap into the fire?",renaissance_love
"     And where it was at wish, it could not remain,",renaissance_love
     Such mocks of dreams they turn to deadly pain.,renaissance_love
"     As virtuous men pass mildly away,",renaissance_love
"   And whisper to their souls to go,",renaissance_love
Whilst some of their sad friends do say,renaissance_love
"   The breath goes now, and some say, No:",renaissance_love
"So let us melt, and make no noise,",renaissance_love
"   No tear-floods, nor sigh-tempests move;",renaissance_love
'Twere profanation of our joys,renaissance_love
   To tell the laity our love.,renaissance_love
"Moving of th' earth brings harms and fears,",renaissance_love
"   Men reckon what it did, and meant;",renaissance_love
"But trepidation of the spheres,",renaissance_love
"   Though greater far, is innocent.",renaissance_love
Dull sublunary lovers' love,renaissance_love
   (Whose soul is sense) cannot admit,renaissance_love
"Absence, because it doth remove",renaissance_love
   Those things which elemented it.,renaissance_love
"But we by a love so much refined,",renaissance_love
"   That our selves know not what it is,",renaissance_love
"Inter-assured of the mind,",renaissance_love
"   Care less, eyes, lips, and hands to miss.",renaissance_love
"Our two souls therefore, which are one,",renaissance_love
"   Though I must go, endure not yet",renaissance_love
"A breach, but an expansion,",renaissance_love
   Like gold to airy thinness beat.,renaissance_love
"If they be two, they are two so",renaissance_love
   As stiff twin compasses are two;,renaissance_love
"Thy soul, the fixed foot, makes no show",renaissance_love
"   To move, but doth, if the other do.",renaissance_love
"And though it in the center sit,",renaissance_love
"   Yet when the other far doth roam,",renaissance_love
"It leans and hearkens after it,",renaissance_love
"   And grows erect, as that comes home.",renaissance_love
"Such wilt thou be to me, who must,",renaissance_love
"   Like th' other foot, obliquely run;",renaissance_love
"Thy firmness makes my circle just,",renaissance_love
   And makes me end where I begun.,renaissance_love
   Let me pour forth,renaissance_love
"My tears before thy face, whilst I stay here,",renaissance_love
"For thy face coins them, and thy stamp they bear,",renaissance_love
"And by this mintage they are something worth,",renaissance_love
         For thus they be,renaissance_love
         Pregnant of thee;,renaissance_love
"Fruits of much grief they are, emblems of more,",renaissance_love
"When a tear falls, that thou falls which it bore,",renaissance_love
"So thou and I are nothing then, when on a diverse shore.",renaissance_love
         On a round ball,renaissance_love
"A workman that hath copies by, can lay",renaissance_love
"An Europe, Afric, and an Asia,",renaissance_love
"And quickly make that, which was nothing, all;",renaissance_love
         So doth each tear,renaissance_love
"         Which thee doth wear,",renaissance_love
"A globe, yea world, by that impression grow,",renaissance_love
Till thy tears mix'd with mine do overflow,renaissance_love
"This world; by waters sent from thee, my heaven dissolved so.",renaissance_love
"         O more than moon,",renaissance_love
"Draw not up seas to drown me in thy sphere,",renaissance_love
"Weep me not dead, in thine arms, but forbear",renaissance_love
To teach the sea what it may do too soon;,renaissance_love
         Let not the wind,renaissance_love
"         Example find,",renaissance_love
To do me more harm than it purposeth;,renaissance_love
"Since thou and I sigh one another's breath,",renaissance_love
"Whoe'er sighs most is cruellest, and hastes the other's death.",renaissance_love
What needeth these threnning words and wasted wind?,renaissance_love
All this cannot make me restore my prey.,renaissance_love
"To rob your good, iwis, is not my mind,",renaissance_love
Nor causeless your fair hand did I display.,renaissance_love
Let love be judge or else whom next we meet,renaissance_love
That may both hear what you and I can say:,renaissance_love
"She took from me an heart, and I a glove from her.",renaissance_love
"Let us see now if th'one be worth th'other.What should I say,",renaissance_love
"Since faith is dead,",renaissance_love
And truth away,renaissance_love
From you is fled?,renaissance_love
Should I be led,renaissance_love
With doubleness?,renaissance_love
"Nay, nay, mistress!",renaissance_love
"I promised you,",renaissance_love
"And you promised me,",renaissance_love
To be as true,renaissance_love
As I would be.,renaissance_love
But since I see,renaissance_love
"Your double heart,",renaissance_love
Farewell my part!,renaissance_love
Though for to take,renaissance_love
"It is not my mind,",renaissance_love
But to forsake,renaissance_love
[One so unkind],renaissance_love
"And as I find,",renaissance_love
So will I trust:,renaissance_love
"Farewell, unjust!",renaissance_love
Can ye say nay?,renaissance_love
But you said,renaissance_love
That I alway,renaissance_love
Should be obeyed?,renaissance_love
And thus betrayed,renaissance_love
Or that I wiste,renaissance_love
"Farewell, unkissed.",renaissance_love
"When thou must home to shades of underground,",renaissance_love
"And there arriv'd, a new admired guest,",renaissance_love
"The beauteous spirits do engirt thee round,",renaissance_love
"White Iope, blithe Helen, and the rest,",renaissance_love
To hear the stories of thy finish'd love,renaissance_love
From that smooth tongue whose music hell can move;,renaissance_love
"Then wilt thou speak of banqueting delights,",renaissance_love
"Of masques and revels which sweet youth did make,",renaissance_love
"Of tourneys and great challenges of knights,",renaissance_love
And all these triumphs for thy beauty's sake:,renaissance_love
"When thou hast told these honours done to thee,",renaissance_love
"Then tell, O tell, how thou didst murder me.",renaissance_love
"Whoso list to hunt, I know where is an hind,",renaissance_love
"But as for me, helas, I may no more.",renaissance_love
"The vain travail hath wearied me so sore,",renaissance_love
I am of them that farthest cometh behind.,renaissance_love
Yet may I by no means my wearied mind,renaissance_love
"Draw from the deer, but as she fleeth afore",renaissance_love
"Fainting I follow. I leave off therefore,",renaissance_love
Sithens in a net I seek to hold the wind.,renaissance_love
"Who list her hunt, I put him out of doubt,",renaissance_love
As well as I may spend his time in vain.,renaissance_love
And graven with diamonds in letters plain,renaissance_love
"There is written, her fair neck round about:",renaissance_love
"Noli me tangere, for Caesar's I am,",renaissance_love
"And wild for to hold, though I seem tame.",renaissance_love
"Ye old mule that think yourself so fair,",renaissance_love
"Leave off with craft your beauty to repair,",renaissance_love
"For it is true, without any fable,",renaissance_love
No man setteth more by riding in your saddle.,renaissance_love
Too much travail so do your train appair.,renaissance_love
        Ye old mule,renaissance_love
"With false savour though you deceive th'air,",renaissance_love
Whoso taste you shall well perceive your lair,renaissance_love
Savoureth somewhat of a Kappurs stable.,renaissance_love
        Ye old mule,renaissance_love
"Ye must now serve to market and to fair,",renaissance_love
"All for the burden, for panniers a pair.",renaissance_love
"For since gray hairs been powdered in your sable,",renaissance_love
"The thing ye seek for, you must yourself enable",renaissance_love
"To purchase it by payment and by prayer,",renaissance_love
Ye old mule.,renaissance_love
Let the bird of loudest lay,neg
On the sole Arabian tree,neg
"Herald sad and trumpet be,",neg
To whose sound chaste wings obey.,neg
"But thou shrieking harbinger,",neg
"Foul precurrer of the fiend,",neg
"Augur of the fever's end,",neg
To this troop come thou not near.,neg
From this session interdict,neg

Keep the obsequy so strict.,neg
"Let the priest in surplice white,",neg

"Be the death-divining swan,",neg
Lest the requiem lack his right.,neg

'Mongst our mourners shalt thou go.,neg
Here the anthem doth commence:,neg
Love and constancy is dead;,neg
Phoenix and the Turtle fled,neg

Had the essence but in one;,neg
"Two distincts, division none:",neg
Number there in love was slain.,neg
"Hearts remote, yet not asunder;",neg
Distance and no space was seen,neg
'Twixt this Turtle and his queen:,neg
But in them it were a wonder.,neg
So between them love did shine,neg
That the Turtle saw his right,neg
Flaming in the Phoenix' sight:,neg
Either was the other's mine.,neg
Property was thus appalled,neg
That the self was not the same;,neg
Single nature's double name,neg
Neither two nor one was called.,neg
"Reason, in itself confounded,",neg
"Saw division grow together,",neg
"To themselves yet either neither,",neg
Simple were so well compounded;,neg
"That it cried, ""How true a twain",neg
Seemeth this concordant one!,neg
"Love has reason, reason none,",neg
"If what parts can so remain.""",neg
Whereupon it made this threne,neg
"To the Phoenix and the Dove,",neg
"Co-supremes and stars of love,",neg
As chorus to their tragic scene:,neg
"Beauty, truth, and rarity,",neg
"Grace in all simplicity,",neg
"Here enclos'd, in cinders lie.",neg
"Death is now the Phoenix' nest,",neg
And the Turtle's loyal breast,neg
"To eternity doth rest,",neg
Leaving no posterity:,neg
"'Twas not their infirmity,",neg
It was married chastity.,neg
Truth may seem but cannot be;,neg
Beauty brag but 'tis not she;,neg
Truth and beauty buried be.,neg
To this urn let those repair,neg
That are either true or fair;,neg
For these dead birds sigh a prayer.,neg
"Sir Charles into my chamber coming in,",neg
When I was writing of my Fairy Queen;,neg
I praysaid hewhen Queen Mab you do see,neg
Present my service to her Majesty:,neg
And tell her I have heard Fame's loud report,neg
Both of her beauty and her stately court.,neg
"When I Queen Mab within my fancy viewed,",neg
"My thoughts bowed low, fearing I should be rude;",neg
"Kissing her garment thin which fancy made,",neg
"I knelt upon a thought, like one that prayed;",neg
"And then, in whispers soft, I did present",neg
His humble service which in mirth was sent;,neg
Thus by imagination I have been,neg
In Fairy court and seen the Fairy Queen.,neg

Sits uncontrolled upon the high extreme.,neg

"Of feigned filthiness, but ours is true.",neg
"Our vice puts down all proverbs and all themes,",neg
Our vice excels all fables and all dreams.,neg

"As time her taught in lowly Shepheards weeds,",neg

"That greatest Gloriana to him gave,",neg
"That greatest Glorious Queene of Faerie lond,",neg
"To winne him worship, and her grace to have,",neg
Which of all earthly things he most did crave;,neg
"And ever as he rode, his hart did earne",neg
To prove his puissance in battell brave,neg
"Upon his foe, and his new force to learne;",neg
"Upon his foe, a Dragon horrible and stearne.",neg
"A lovely Ladie rode him faire beside,",neg
"Upon a lowly Asse more white then snow,",neg
"Yet she much whiter, but the same did hide",neg
"Under a vele, that wimpled was full low,",neg
"And over all a blacke stole she did throw,",neg
"As one that inly mournd: so was she sad,",neg
And heavie sat upon her palfrey slow;,neg
"Seemed in heart some hidden care she had,",neg
And by her in a line a milke white lambe she lad.,neg
"So pure an innocent, as that same lambe,",neg
"She was in life and every vertuous lore,",neg
And by descent from Royall lynage came,neg
"Of ancient Kings and Queenes, that had of yore",neg
"Their scepters stretcht from East to Westerne shore,",neg
And all the world in their subjection held;,neg
Till that infernall feend with foule uprore,neg
"Forwasted all their land, and them expeld:",neg
"Whom to avenge, she had this Knight from far compeld.",neg
"Behind her farre away a Dwarfe did lag,",neg
"That lasie seemd in being ever last,",neg
Or wearied with bearing of her bag,neg
"Of needments at his backe. Thus as they past,",neg
"The day with cloudes was suddeine overcast,",neg
And angry Jove an hideous storme of raine,neg
"Did poure into his Lemans lap so fast,",neg
"That every wight to shrowd it did constrain,",neg
And this faire couple eke to shroud themselves were fain.,neg
"Enforst to seeke some covert nigh at hand,",neg
"A shadie grove not far away they spide,",neg
That promist ayde the tempest to withstand:,neg
"Whose loftie trees yclad with sommers pride,",neg
"Did spred so broad, that heavens light did hide,",neg
Not perceable with power of any starre:,neg
"And all within were pathes and alleies wide,",neg
"With footing worne, and leading inward farre:",neg
Faire harbour that them seemes; so in they entred arre.,neg
"And foorth they passe, with pleasure forward led,",neg
"Joying to heare the birdes sweete harmony,",neg
"Which therein shrouded from the tempest dred,",neg
Seemd in their song to scorne the cruell sky.,neg
"Much can they prayse the trees so straight and hy,",neg
"The sayling Pine, the Cedar proud and tall,",neg
"The vine-prop Elme, the Poplar never dry,",neg
"The builder Oake, sole king of forrests all,",neg
"The Aspine good for staves, the Cypresse funerall.",neg

"The carver Holme, the Maple seeldom inward sound.",neg
"Led with delight, they thus beguile the way,",neg
Untill the blustring storme is overblowne;,neg
"When weening to returne, whence they did stray,",neg
"They cannot find that path, which first was showne,",neg
"But wander too and fro in wayes unknowne,",neg
"Furthest from end then, when they neerest weene,",neg
"That makes them doubt, their wits be not their owne:",neg
"So many pathes, so many turnings seene,",neg
"That which of them to take, in diverse doubt they been.",neg
"At last resolving forward still to fare,",neg
"Till that some end they finde or in or out,",neg
"That path they take, that beaten seemd most bare,",neg
And like to lead the labyrinth about;,neg
"Which when by tract they hunted had throughout,",neg
"At length it brought them to a hollow cave,",neg
Amid the thickest woods. The Champion stout,neg
"Eftsoones dismounted from his courser brave,",neg
And to the Dwarfe a while his needlesse spere he gave.,neg
"Be well aware, quoth then that Ladie milde,",neg
Least suddaine mischiefe ye too rash provoke:,neg
"The danger hid, the place unknowne and wilde,",neg
"Breeds dreadfull doubts: Oft fire is without smoke,",neg
And perill without show: therefore your stroke,neg
"Sir knight with-hold, till further triall made.",neg
Ah Ladie (said he) shame were to revoke,neg
The forward footing for an hidden shade:,neg
"Vertue gives her selfe light, through darkenesse for to wade.",neg
Yea but (quoth she) the perill of this place,neg
"I better wot then you, though now too late",neg
"To wish you backe returne with foule disgrace,",neg
"Yet wisedome warnes, whilest foot is in the gate,",neg
"To stay the steppe, ere forced to retrate.",neg
"This is the wandring wood, this Errours den,",neg
"A monster vile, whom God and man does hate:",neg
Therefore I read beware. Fly fly (quoth then,neg
The fearefull Dwarfe:) this is no place for living men.,neg
"But full of fire and greedy hardiment,",neg
"The youthfull knight could not for ought be staide,",neg
"But forth unto the darksome hole he went,",neg
And looked in: his glistring armor made,neg
"A litle glooming light, much like a shade,",neg
"By which he saw the ugly monster plaine,",neg
"Halfe like a serpent horribly displaide,",neg
"But th'other halfe did womans shape retaine,",neg
"Most lothsom, filthie, foule, and full of vile disdaine.",neg
"And as she lay upon the durtie ground,",neg
"Her huge long taile her den all overspred,",neg
"Yet was in knots and many boughtes upwound,",neg
Pointed with mortall sting. Of her there bred,neg
"A thousand yong ones, which she dayly fed,",neg
"Sucking upon her poisonous dugs, eachone",neg
"Of sundry shapes, yet all ill favored:",neg
"Soone as that uncouth light upon them shone,",neg
"Into her mouth they crept, and suddain all were gone.",neg
"Their dam upstart, out of her den effraide,",neg
"And rushed forth, hurling her hideous taile",neg
"About her cursed head, whose folds displaid",neg
Were stretcht now forth at length without entraile.,neg
"She lookt about, and seeing one in mayle",neg
"Armed to point, sought backe to turne againe;",neg
"For light she hated as the deadly bale,",neg
"Ay wont in desert darknesse to remaine,",neg
"Where plaine none might her see, nor she see any plaine.",neg
"Which when the valiant Elfe perceiv'd, he lept",neg
"As Lyon fierce upon the flying pray,",neg
And with his trenchand blade her boldly kept,neg
"From turning backe, and forced her to stay:",neg
"Therewith enrag'd she loudly gan to bray,",neg
"And turning fierce, her speckled taile advaunst,",neg
"Threatning her angry sting, him to dismay:",neg
"Who nought aghast, his mightie hand enhaunst:",neg
The stroke down from her head unto her shoulder glaunst.,neg
"Much daunted with that dint, her sence was dazd,",neg
"Yet kindling rage, her selfe she gathered round,",neg
And all attonce her beastly body raizd,neg
With doubled forces high above the ground:,neg
"Tho wrapping up her wrethed sterne arownd,",neg
"Lept fierce upon his shield, and her huge traine",neg
"All suddenly about his body wound,",neg
That hand or foot to stirre he strove in vaine:,neg
God helpe the man so wrapt in Errours endlesse traine.,neg
"His Lady sad to see his sore constraint,",neg
"Cride out, Now now Sir knight, shew what ye bee,",neg
"Add faith unto your force, and be not faint:",neg
"Strangle her, else she sure will strangle thee.",neg
"That when he heard, in great perplexitie,",neg
"His gall did grate for griefe and high disdaine,",neg
"And knitting all his force got one hand free,",neg
"Wherewith he grypt her gorge with so great paine,",neg
That soone to loose her wicked bands did her constraine.,neg
Therewith she spewd out of her filthy maw,neg
"A floud of poyson horrible and blacke,",neg
"Full of great lumpes of flesh and gobbets raw,",neg
"Which stunck so vildly, that it forst him slacke",neg
"His grasping hold, and from her turne him backe:",neg
"Her vomit full of bookes and papers was,",neg
"With loathly frogs and toades, which eyes did lacke,",neg
And creeping sought way in the weedy gras:,neg
Her filthy parbreake all the place defiled has.,neg
As when old father Nilus gins to swell,neg
"With timely pride above the Aegyptian vale,",neg
"His fattie waves do fertile slime outwell,",neg
And overflow each plaine and lowly dale:,neg
"But when his later spring gins to avale,",neg
"Huge heapes of mudd he leaves, wherein there breed",neg
"Ten thousand kindes of creatures, partly male",neg
And partly female of his fruitfull seed;,neg
Such ugly monstrous shapes elsewhere may no man reed.,neg
"The same so sore annoyed has the knight,",neg
"That welnigh choked with the deadly stinke,",neg
"His forces faile, ne can no longer fight.",neg
"Whose corage when the feend perceiv'd to shrinke,",neg
She poured forth out of her hellish sinke,neg
"Her fruitfull cursed spawne of serpents small,",neg
"Deformed monsters, fowle, and blacke as inke,",neg
"Which swarming all about his legs did crall,",neg
"And him encombred sore, but could not hurt at all.",neg
"As gentle Shepheard in sweete even-tide,",neg
"When ruddy Phoebus gins to welke in west,",neg
"High on an hill, his flocke to vewen wide,",neg
Markes which do byte their hasty supper best;,neg
"A cloud of combrous gnattes do him molest,",neg
"All striving to infixe their feeble stings,",neg
"That from their noyance he no where can rest,",neg
But with his clownish hands their tender wings,neg
"He brusheth oft, and oft doth mar their murmurings.",neg
"Thus ill bestedd, and fearefull more of shame,",neg
"Then of the certaine perill he stood in,",neg
"Halfe furious unto his foe he came,",neg
"Resolv'd in minde all suddenly to win,",neg
"Or soone to lose, before he once would lin;",neg
"And strooke at her with more then manly force,",neg
That from her body full of filthie sin,neg
He raft her hatefull head without remorse;,neg
A streame of cole black bloud forth gushed from her corse.,neg
"Her scattred brood, soone as their Parent deare",neg
"They saw so rudely falling to the ground,",neg
"Groning full deadly, all with troublous feare,",neg
"Gathred themselves about her body round,",neg
Weening their wonted entrance to have found,neg
At her wide mouth: but being there withstood,neg
"They flocked all about her bleeding wound,",neg
"And sucked up their dying mothers blood,",neg
"Making her death their life, and eke her hurt their good.",neg
"That detestable sight him much amazde,",neg
"To see th'unkindly Impes of heaven accurst,",neg
"Devoure their dam; on whom while so he gazd,",neg
"Having all satisfide their bloudy thurst,",neg
"Their bellies swolne he saw with fulnesse burst,",neg
And bowels gushing forth: well worthy end,neg
"Of such as drunke her life, the which them nurst;",neg
"Now needeth him no lenger labour spend,",neg
"His foes have slaine themselves, with whom he should contend.",neg
"His Ladie seeing all, that chaunst, from farre",neg
"Approcht in hast to greet his victorie,",neg
"And said, Faire knight, borne under happy starre,",neg
Who see your vanquisht foes before you lye:,neg
"Well worthy be you of that Armorie,",neg
"Wherein ye have great glory wonne this day,",neg
"And proov'd your strength on a strong enimie,",neg
"Your first adventure: many such I pray,",neg
"And henceforth ever wish, that like succeed it may.",neg
"Then mounted he upon his Steede againe,",neg
And with the Lady backward sought to wend;,neg
"That path he kept, which beaten was most plame,",neg
"Ne ever would to any by-way bend,",neg
"But still did follow one unto the end,",neg
The which at last out of the wood them brought.,neg
So forward on his way (with God to frend),neg
"He passed forth, and new adventure sought;",neg
"Long way he travelled, before he heard of ought.",neg
At length they chaunst to meet upon the way,neg
"An aged Sire, in long blacke weedes yclad,",neg
"His feete all bare, his beard all hoarie gray,",neg
And by his belt his booke he hanging had;,neg
"Sober he seemde, and very sagely sad,",neg
"And to the ground his eyes were lowly bent,",neg
"Simple in shew, and voyde of malice bad,",neg
"And all the way he prayed, as he went,",neg
"And often knockt his brest, as one that did repent.",neg
"He faire the knight saluted, louting low,",neg
"Who faire him quited, as that courteous was:",neg
"And after asked him, if he did know",neg
"Of straunge adventures, which abroad did pas.",neg
"Ah my deare Sonne (quoth he) how should, alas,",neg
"Silly old man, that lives in hidden cell,",neg
"Bidding his beades all day for his trespas,",neg
Tydings of warre and worldly trouble tell?,neg
With holy father sits not with such things to mell.,neg
"But if of daunger which hereby doth dwell,",neg
"And homebred evill ye desire to heare,",neg
"Of a straunge man I can you tidings tell,",neg
That wasteth all this countrey farre and neare.,neg
"Of such (said he) I chiefly do inquere,",neg
"And shall you well reward to shew the place,",neg
In which that wicked wight his dayes doth weare:,neg
"For to all knighthood it is foule disgrace,",neg
That such a cursed creature lives so long a space.,neg
Far hence (quoth he) in wastfull wildernesse,neg
"His dwelling is, by which no living wight",neg
"May ever passe, but thorough great distresse.",neg
"Now (sayd the Lady) draweth toward night,",neg
"And well I wote, that of your later fight",neg
"Ye all forwearied be: for what so strong,",neg
But wanting rest will also want of might?,neg
"The Sunne that measures heaven all day long,",neg
At night doth baite his steedes the Ocean waves emong.,neg
"Then with the Sunne take Sir, your timely rest,",neg
And with new day new worke at once begin:,neg
Untroubled night they say gives counsell best.,neg
"Right well Sir knight ye have advised bin,",neg
(Quoth then that aged man;) the way to win,neg
Is wisely to advise: now day is spent;,neg
Therefore with me ye may take up your In,neg
For this same night. The knight was well content:,neg
So with that godly father to his home they went.,neg
"A little lowly Hermitage it was,",neg
"Downe in a dale, hard by a forests side,",neg
"Far from resort of people, that did pas",neg
In travell to and froe: a little wyde,neg
"There was an holy Chappell edifyde,",neg
Wherein the Hermite dewly wont to say,neg
His holy things each morne and eventyde:,neg
"Thereby a Christall streame did gently play,",neg
Which from a sacred fountaine welled forth alway.,neg
"Arrived there, the little house they fill,",neg
"Ne looke for entertainement, where none was:",neg
"Rest is their feast, and all things at their will;",neg
The noblest mind the best contentment has.,neg
With faire discourse the evening so they pas:,neg
"For that old man of pleasing wordes had store,",neg
And well could file his tongue as smooth as glas;,neg
"He told of Saintes and Popes, and evermore",neg
He strowd an Ave-Mary after and before.,neg
"The drouping Night thus creepeth on them fast,",neg
"And the sad humour loading their eye liddes,",neg
As messenger of Morpheus on them cast,neg
"Sweet slombring deaw, the which to sleepe them biddes.",neg
Unto their lodgings then his guestes he riddes:,neg
"Where when all drownd in deadly sleepe he findes,",neg
"He to his study goes, and there amiddes",neg
"His Magick bookes and artes of sundry kindes,",neg
"He seekes out mighty charmes, to trouble sleepy mindes.",neg
"Then choosing out few wordes most horrible,",neg
"(Let none them read) thereof did verses frame,",neg
"With which and other spelles like terrible,",neg
"He bad awake blacke Plutoes griesly Dame,",neg
"And cursed heaven, and spake reprochfull shame",neg
"Of highest God, the Lord of life and light;",neg
"A bold bad man, that dar'd to call by name",neg
"Great Gorgon, Prince of darknesse and dead night,",neg
"At which Cocytus quakes, and Styx is put to flight.",neg
And forth he cald out of deepe darknesse dred,neg
"Legions of Sprights, the which like little flyes",neg
"Fluttring about his ever damned hed,",neg
"A-waite whereto their service he applyes,",neg
"To aide his friends, or fray his enimies:",neg
"Of those he chose out two, the falsest twoo,",neg
And fittest for to forge true-seeming lyes;,neg
"The one of them he gave a message too,",neg
The other by him selfe staide other worke to doo.,neg
"He making speedy way through spersed ayre,",neg
"And through the world of waters wide and peepe,",neg
To Morpheus house doth hastily repaire.,neg
"Amid the bowels of the earth full steepe,",neg
"And low, where dawning day doth never peepe,",neg
His dwelling is; there Tethys his wet bed,neg
"Doth ever wash, and Cynthia still doth steepe",neg
"In silver deaw his ever-drouping hed,",neg
Whiles sad Night over him her mantle black doth spred.,neg
"Whose double gates he findeth locked fast,",neg
"The one faire fram'd of burnisht Yvory,",neg
The other all with silver overcast;,neg
And wakefull dogges before them farre do lye,neg
"Watching to banish Care their enimy,",neg
Who oft is wont to trouble gentle Sleepe.,neg
"By them the Sprite doth passe in quietly,",neg
"And unto Morpheus comes, whom drowned deepe",neg
In drowsie fit he findes: of nothing he takes keepe.,neg
"And more, to lulle him in his slumber soft,",neg
A trickling streame from high rocke tumbling downe,neg
"And ever-drizling raine upon the loft,",neg
"Mixt with a murmuring winde, much like the sowne",neg
"Of swarming Bees, did cast him in a swowne:",neg
"No other noyse, nor peoples troublous cryes,",neg
"As still are wont t'annoy the walled towne,",neg
"Might there be heard: but carelesse Quiet lyes,",neg
Wrapt in eternall silence farre from enemyes.,neg
"The messenger approching to him spake,",neg
But his wast wordes returnd to him in vaine:,neg
"So sound he slept, that nought mought him awake.",neg
"Then rudely he him thrust, and pusht with paine,",neg
Whereat he gan to stretch: but he againe,neg
"Shooke him so hard, that forced him to speake.",neg
"As one then in a dreame, whose dryer braine",neg
"In tost with troubled sights and fancies weake,",neg
"He mumbled soft, but would not all his silence breake.",neg
"The Sprite then gan more boldly him to wake,",neg
And threatned unto him the dreaded name,neg
"Of Hecate: whereat he gan to quake,",neg
"And lifting up his lumpish head, with blame",neg
"Halfe angry asked him, for what he came.",neg
"Hither (quoth he) me Archimago sent,",neg
"He that the stubborne Sprites can wisely tame,",neg
He bids thee to him send for his intent,neg
"A fit false dreame, that can delude the sleepers sent.",neg
"The God obayde, and calling forth straight way",neg
"A diverse dreame out of his prison darke,",neg
"Delivered it to him, and downe did lay",neg
"His heavie head, devoide of carefull carke,",neg
Whose sences all were straight benumbed and starke.,neg
"He backe returning by the Yvorie dore,",neg
"Remounted up as light as chearefull Larke,",neg
And on his litle winges the dreame he bore,neg
"In hast unto his Lord, where he him left afore.",neg
"Who all this while with charmes and hidden artes,",neg
"Had made a Lady of that other Spright,",neg
And fram'd of liquid ayre her tender partes,neg
"So lively, and so like in all mens sight,",neg
That weaker sence it could have ravisht quight:,neg
"The maker selfe for all his wondrous witt,",neg
Was nigh beguiled with so goodly sight:,neg
"Her all in white he clad, and over it",neg
"Cast a blacke stole, most like to seeme for Una fit.",neg
"Now when that ydle dreame was to him brought,",neg
"Unto that Elfin knight he bad him fly,",neg
Where he slept soundly void of evill thought,neg
"And with false shewes abuse his fantasy,",neg
In sort as he him schooled privily:,neg
"And that new creature borne without her dew,",neg
"Full of the makers guile, with usage sly",neg
"He taught to imitate that Lady trew,",neg
Whose semblance she did carrie under feigned hew.,neg
"Thus well instructed, to their worke they hast,",neg
"And comming where the knight in slomber lay,",neg
"The one upon his hardy head him plast,",neg
"And made him dreame of loves and lustfull play,",neg
"That nigh his manly hart did melt away,",neg
Bathed in wanton blis and wicked joy:,neg
"Then seemed him his Lady by him lay,",neg
"And to him playnd, how that false winged boy,",neg
"Her chast hart had subdewd, to learne Dame pleasures toy.",neg
"And she her selfe of beautie soveraigne Queene,",neg
Faire Venus seemde unto his bed to bring,neg
"Her, whom he waking evermore did weene,",neg
"To be the chastest flowre, that ay did spring",neg
"On earthly braunch, the daughter of a king,",neg
Now a loose Leman to vile service bound:,neg
"And eke the Graces seemed all to sing,",neg
"Hymen {i}{_o} Hymen, dauncing all around,",neg
While freshest Flora her with Yvie girlond crownd.,neg
"In this great passion of unwonted lust,",neg
"Or wonted feare of doing ought amis,",neg
"He started up, as seeming to mistrust",neg
"Some secret ill, or hidden foe of his:",neg
"Lo there before his face his Lady is,",neg
"Under blake stole hyding her bayted hooke,",neg
"And as halfe blushing offred him to kis,",neg
"With gentle blandishment and lovely looke,",neg
"Most like that virgin true, which for her knight him took.",neg
"All cleane dismayd to see so uncouth sight,",neg

He thought have slaine her in his fierce despight:,neg
"But hasty heat tempring with sufferance wise,",neg

"To prove his sense, and tempt her faigned truth.",neg
"Wringing her hands in wemens pitteous wise,",neg
"Tho can she weepe, to stirre up gentle ruth,",neg
"Both for her noble bloud, and for her tender youth.",neg
"And said, Ah Sir, my liege Lord and my love,",neg
"Shall I accuse the hidden cruell fate,",neg
"And mightie causes wrought in heaven above,",neg
"Or the blind God, that doth me thus amate,",neg
For hoped love to winne me certaine hate?,neg
"Yet thus perforce he bids me do, or die.",neg
Die is my dew: yet rew my wretched state,neg
"You, whom my hard avenging destinie",neg
Hath made judge of my life or death indifferently.,neg
Your owne deare sake forst me at first to leave,neg
"My Fathers kingdome, There she stopt with teares;",neg
"Her swollen hart her speach seemd to bereave,",neg
"And then againe begun, My weaker yeares",neg
"Captiv'd to fortune and frayle worldly feares,",neg
Fly to your faith for succour and sure ayde:,neg
Let me not dye in languor and long teares.,neg
Why Dame (quoth he) what hath ye thus dismayd?,neg
"What frayes ye, that were wont to comfort me affrayd?",neg
"Love of your selfe, she said, and deare constraint",neg
"Lets me not sleepe, but wast the wearie night",neg
"In secret anguish and unpittied plaint,",neg
Whiles you in carelesse sleepe are drowned quight.,neg
Her doubtfull words made that redoubted knight,neg
"Suspect her truth: yet since no'untruth he knew,",neg
Her fawning love with foule disdainefull spight,neg
"He would not shend, but said, Deare dame I rew,",neg
That for my sake unknowne such griefe unto you grew.,neg
"Assure your selfe, it fell not all to ground;",neg
"For all so deare as life is to my hart,",neg

"Long after lay he musing at her mood,",neg
"Much griev'd to think that gentle Dame so light,",neg
For whose defence he was to shed his blood.,neg
At last dull wearinesse of former fight,neg
"Having yrockt a sleepe his irkesome spright,",neg
"That troublous dreame gan freshly tosse his braine,",neg
"With bowres, and beds, and Ladies deare delight:",neg

With that misformed spright he backe returnd againe.,neg
"Long have I longd to see my love againe,",neg
"Still have I wisht, but never could obtaine it;",neg
Rather than all the world (if I might gaine it),neg
Would I desire my loves sweet precious gaine.,neg
"Yet in my soule I see him everie day,",neg

Where majestie and beautie beares the sway?,neg

With lovely tincture which Apollos dims.,neg

His teeth pure pearle in blushing correll set.,neg

"Or whose is that faire face, that shines so bright,",neg
"Is it not Cinthia, she that never sleepes,",neg
But walkes about high heaven al the night?,neg
"O fayrest goddesse, do thou not envy",neg
My love with me to spy:,neg
"For thou likewise didst love, though now unthought,",neg
"And for a fleece of woll, which privily,",neg
"The Latmian shephard once unto thee brought,",neg
His pleasures with thee wrought.,neg
Therefore to us be favorable now;,neg
"And sith of wemens labours thou hast charge,",neg
"And generation goodly dost enlarge,",neg
"Encline thy will t'effect our wishfull vow,",neg
"And the chast wombe informe with timely seed,",neg
That may our comfort breed:,neg
"Till which we cease our hopefull hap to sing,",neg
"Ne let the woods us answere, nor our Eccho ring.",neg
"And thou great Juno, which with awful might",neg
"The lawes of wedlock still dost patronize,",neg
And the religion of the faith first plight,neg
With sacred rites hast taught to solemnize:,neg
And eeke for comfort often called art,neg
"Of women in their smart,",neg
"Eternally bind thou this lovely band,",neg
And all thy blessings unto us impart.,neg
"And thou glad Genius, in whose gentle hand,",neg
"The bridale bowre and geniall bed remaine,",neg
"Without blemish or staine,",neg
And the sweet pleasures of theyr loves delight,neg
"With secret ayde doest succour and supply,",neg
"Till they bring forth the fruitfull progeny,",neg
Send us the timely fruit of this same night.,neg
"And thou fayre Hebe, and thou Hymen free,",neg
Grant that it may so be.,neg
"Til which we cease your further prayse to sing,",neg
"Ne any woods shal answer, nor your Eccho ring.",neg
"And ye high heavens, the temple of the gods,",neg
In which a thousand torches flaming bright,neg
"Doe burne, that to us wretched earthly clods,",neg
In dreadful darknesse lend desired light;,neg
"And all ye powers which in the same remayne,",neg
"More then we men can fayne,",neg
"Poure out your blessing on us plentiously,",neg
"And happy influence upon us raine,",neg
"That we may raise a large posterity,",neg
"Which from the earth, which they may long possesse,",neg
"With lasting happinesse,",neg
"Up to your haughty pallaces may mount,",neg
And for the guerdon of theyr glorious merit,neg
"May heavenly tabernacles there inherit,",neg
Of blessed Saints for to increase the count.,neg
"So let us rest, sweet love, in hope of this,",neg
"And cease till then our tymely joyes to sing,",neg
"The woods no more us answer, nor our eccho ring.",neg
"Song made in lieu of many ornaments,",neg
"With which my love should duly have bene dect,",neg
"Which cutting off through hasty accidents,",neg
"Ye would not stay your dew time to expect,",neg
"But promist both to recompens,",neg
"Be unto her a goodly ornament,",neg
And for short time an endlesse moniment.,neg
"On Hellespont, guilty of true love's blood,",neg
"In view and opposite two cities stood,",neg
"Sea-borderers, disjoin'd by Neptune's might;",neg
"The one Abydos, the other Sestos hight.",neg
"At Sestos Hero dwelt; Hero the fair,",neg
"Whom young Apollo courted for her hair,",neg
"And offer'd as a dower his burning throne,",neg
Where she could sit for men to gaze upon.,neg
"The outside of her garments were of lawn,",neg
"The lining purple silk, with gilt stars drawn;",neg
"Her wide sleeves green, and border'd with a grove,",neg
Where Venus in her naked glory strove,neg
To please the careless and disdainful eyes,neg
"Of proud Adonis, that before her lies;",neg
"Her kirtle blue, whereon was many a stain,",neg
Made with the blood of wretched lovers slain.,neg
"Upon her head she ware a myrtle wreath,",neg
From whence her veil reach'd to the ground beneath;,neg
"Her veil was artificial flowers and leaves,",neg
Whose workmanship both man and beast deceives;,neg
"Many would praise the sweet smell as she past,",neg
When 'twas the odour which her breath forth cast;,neg
"And there for honey bees have sought in vain,",neg
"And beat from thence, have lighted there again.",neg
"About her neck hung chains of pebble-stone,",neg
"Which lighten'd by her neck, like diamonds shone.",neg
She ware no gloves; for neither sun nor wind,neg
"Would burn or parch her hands, but, to her mind,",neg
"Or warm or cool them, for they took delight",neg
"To play upon those hands, they were so white.",neg
"Buskins of shells, all silver'd, used she,",neg
And branch'd with blushing coral to the knee;,neg
"Where sparrows perch'd, of hollow pearl and gold,",neg
Such as the world would wonder to behold:,neg
"Those with sweet water oft her handmaid fills,",neg
"Which as she went, would chirrup through the bills.",neg
"Some say, for her the fairest Cupid pin'd,",neg
"And looking in her face, was strooken blind.",neg
"But this is true; so like was one the other,",neg
As he imagin'd Hero was his mother;,neg
"And oftentimes into her bosom flew,",neg
"About her naked neck his bare arms threw,",neg
"And laid his childish head upon her breast,",neg
And with still panting rock'd there took his rest.,neg
"So lovely-fair was Hero, Venus' nun,",neg
"As Nature wept, thinking she was undone,",neg
"Because she took more from her than she left,",neg
And of such wondrous beauty her bereft:,neg
"Therefore, in sign her treasure suffer'd wrack,",neg
Since Hero's time hath half the world been black.,neg
"         Amorous Leander, beautiful and young",neg
"(Whose tragedy divine Musus sung),",neg
Dwelt at Abydos; since him dwelt there none,neg
For whom succeeding times make greater moan.,neg
"His dangling tresses, that were never shorn,",neg
"Had they been cut, and unto Colchos borne,",neg
Would have allur'd the vent'rous youth of Greece,neg
To hazard more than for the golden fleece.,neg
Fair Cynthia wish'd his arms might be her sphere;,neg
"Grief makes her pale, because she moves not there.",neg
His body was as straight as Circe's wand;,neg
Jove might have sipt out nectar from his hand.,neg
"Even as delicious meat is to the taste,",neg
"So was his neck in touching, and surpast",neg
"The white of Pelops' shoulder: I could tell ye,",neg
"How smooth his breast was, and how white his belly;",neg
And whose immortal fingers did imprint,neg
That heavenly path with many a curious dint,neg
That runs along his back; but my rude pen,neg
"Can hardly blazon forth the loves of men,",neg
Much less of powerful gods: let it suffice,neg
That my slack Muse sings of Leander's eyes;,neg
"Those orient cheeks and lips, exceeding his",neg
That leapt into the water for a kiss,neg
"Of his own shadow, and, despising many,",neg
Died ere he could enjoy the love of any.,neg
"Had wild Hippolytus Leander seen,",neg
Enamour'd of his beauty had he been.,neg
"His presence made the rudest peasant melt,",neg
That in the vast uplandish country dwelt;,neg
"The barbarous Thracian soldier, mov'd with nought,",neg
"Was mov'd with him, and for his favour sought.",neg
"Some swore he was a maid in man's attire,",neg
"For in his looks were all that men desire,",neg
"A pleasant smiling cheek, a speaking eye,",neg
A brow for love to banquet royally;,neg
"And such as knew he was a man, would say,",neg
"Leander, thou art made for amorous play;",neg
"Why art thou not in love, and lov'd of all?",neg
"Though thou be fair, yet be not thine own thrall.",neg
"         The men of wealthy Sestos every year,",neg
"For his sake whom their goddess held so dear,",neg
"Rose-cheek'd Adonis, kept a solemn feast.",neg
Thither resorted many a wandering guest,neg
To meet their loves; such as had none at all,neg
Came lovers home from this great festival;,neg
"For every street, like to a firmament,",neg
"Glister'd with breathing stars, who, where they went,",neg
"Frighted the melancholy earth, which deem'd",neg
"Eternal heaven to burn, for so it seem'd",neg
"As if another Pha{""e}ton had got",neg
The guidance of the sun's rich chariot.,neg
"But far above the loveliest, Hero shin'd,",neg
And stole away th' enchanted gazer's mind;,neg
"For like sea-nymphs' inveigling harmony,",neg
So was her beauty to the standers-by;,neg
"Nor that night-wandering, pale, and watery star",neg
(When yawning dragons draw her thirling car,neg
"From Latmus' mount up to the gloomy sky,",neg
"Where, crown'd with blazing light and majesty,",neg
She proudly sits) more over-rules the flood,neg
Than she the hearts of those that near her stood.,neg
"Even as when gaudy nymphs pursue the chase,",neg
"Wretched Ixion's shaggy-footed race,",neg
"Incens'd with savage heat, gallop amain",neg
"From steep pine-bearing mountains to the plain,",neg
"So ran the people forth to gaze upon her,",neg
And all that view'd her were enamour'd on her.,neg
"And as in fury of a dreadful fight,",neg
"Their fellows being slain or put to flight,",neg
"Poor soldiers stand with fear of death dead-strooken,",neg
"So at her presence all surpris'd and tooken,",neg
Await the sentence of her scornful eyes;,neg
He whom she favours lives; the other dies.,neg
"There might you see one sigh, another rage,",neg
"And some, their violent passions to assuage,",neg
"Compile sharp satires; but, alas, too late,",neg
For faithful love will never turn to hate.,neg
"And many, seeing great princes were denied,",neg
"Pin'd as they went, and thinking on her, died.",neg
On this feast-dayO cursed day and hour!,neg
"Went Hero thorough Sestos, from her tower",neg
"To Venus' temple, where unhappily,",neg
"As after chanc'd, they did each other spy.",neg
So fair a church as this had Venus none:,neg
"The walls were of discolour'd jasper-stone,",neg
Wherein was Proteus carved; and over-head,neg
"A lively vine of green sea-agate spread,",neg
"Where by one hand light-headed Bacchus hung,",neg
And with the other wine from grapes out-wrung.,neg
Of crystal shining fair the pavement was;,neg
The town of Sestos call'd it Venus' glass:,neg
"There might you see the gods in sundry shapes,",neg
"Committing heady riots, incest, rapes:",neg
"For know, that underneath this radiant flower",neg
"Was Danae's statue in a brazen tower,",neg
"Jove slyly stealing from his sister's bed,",neg
"To dally with Idalian Ganimed,",neg
"And for his love Europa bellowing loud,",neg
And tumbling with the rainbow in a cloud;,neg
"Blood-quaffing Mars heaving the iron net,",neg
Which limping Vulcan and his Cyclops set;,neg
"Love kindling fire, to burn such towns as Troy,",neg
Sylvanus weeping for the lovely boy,neg
"That now is turn'd into a cypress tree,",neg
Under whose shade the wood-gods love to be.,neg
And in the midst a silver altar stood:,neg
"There Hero, sacrificing turtles' blood,",neg
"Vail'd to the ground, veiling her eyelids close;",neg
And modestly they opened as she rose.,neg
Thence flew Love's arrow with the golden head;,neg
And thus Leander was enamoured.,neg
"Stone-still he stood, and evermore he gazed,",neg
Till with the fire that from his count'nance blazed,neg
Relenting Hero's gentle heart was strook:,neg
Such force and virtue hath an amorous look.,neg
"         It lies not in our power to love or hate,",neg
For will in us is over-rul'd by fate.,neg
"When two are stript, long ere the course begin,",neg
"We wish that one should lose, the other win;",neg
And one especially do we affect,neg
"Of two gold ingots, like in each respect:",neg
"The reason no man knows, let it suffice,",neg
What we behold is censur'd by our eyes.,neg
"Where both deliberate, the love is slight:",neg
"Who ever lov'd, that lov'd not at first sight?",neg
"By that he ended had his ghostly sermon,",neg
"The fox was well induc'd to be a parson,",neg
"And of the priest eftsoons gan to inquire,",neg
How to a benefice he might aspire.,neg
"Marry, there (said the priest) ""is art indeed:",neg
Much good deep learning one thereout may read;,neg
"For that the ground-work is, and end of all,",neg
How to obtain a beneficial.,neg
"First, therefore, when ye have in handsome wise",neg
"Yourself attired, as you can devise,",neg
"Then to some nobleman yourself apply,",neg
"Or other great one in the worldes eye,",neg
That hath a zealous disposition,neg
"To God, and so to his religion.",neg
"There must thou fashion eke a godly zeal,",neg
Such as no carpers may contrare reveal;,neg
For each thing feigned ought more wary be.,neg
"There thou must walk in sober gravity,",neg
And seem as saint-like as Saint Radegund:,neg
"Fast much, pray oft, look lowly on the ground,",neg
And unto every one do courtesy meek:,neg
"These looks (nought saying) do a benefice seek,",neg
But be thou sure one not to lack or long.,neg
"And if thee list unto the court to throng,",neg
"And there to hunt after the hoped prey,",neg
Then must thou thee dispose another way:,neg
"For there thou needs must learn to laugh, to lie,",neg
"To face, to forge, to scoff, to company,",neg
"To crouch, to please, to be a beetle-stock",neg
"Of thy great master's will, to scorn, or mock.",neg
"So may'st thou chance mock out a benefice,",neg
"Unless thou canst one conjure by device,",neg
Or cast a figure for a bishopric;,neg
"And if one could, it were but a school trick.",neg
These be the ways by which without reward,neg
"Livings in court be gotten, though full hard;",neg
For nothing there is done without a fee:,neg
The courtier needs must recompensed be,neg
"With a benevolence, or have in gage",neg
The primitias of your parsonage:,neg
"Scarce can a bishopric forpass them by,",neg
But that it must be gelt in privity.,neg
"Do not thou therefore seek a living there,",neg
"But of more private persons seek elsewhere,",neg
"Whereas thou may'st compound a better penny,",neg
Ne let thy learning question'd be of any.,neg
"For some good gentleman, that hath the right",neg
"Unto his church for to present a wight,",neg
Will cope with thee in reasonable wise;,neg
That if the living yearly do arise,neg
"To forty pound, that then his youngest son",neg
"Shall twenty have, and twenty thou hast won:",neg
"Thou hast it won, for it is of frank gift,",neg
"And he will care for all the rest to shift,",neg
"Both that the bishop may admit of thee,",neg
And that therein thou may'st maintained be.,neg
This is the way for one that is unlearn'd,neg
"Living to get, and not to be discern'd.",neg
"But they that are great clerks, have nearer ways,",neg
For learning sake to living them to raise;,neg
Yet many eke of them (God wot) are driven,neg
T' accept a benefice in pieces riven.,neg
"How say'st thou (friend), have I not well discourst",neg
"Upon this common-place (though plain, not worst)?",neg
Better a short tale than a bad long shriving.,neg
"Needs any more to learn to get a living?""",neg
"Now sure, and by my halidom, (quoth he)",neg
Ye a great master are in your degree:,neg
"Great thanks I yield you for your discipline,",neg
And do not doubt but duly to incline,neg
"My wits thereto, as ye shall shortly hear.",neg
"The priest him wish'd good speed, and well to fare:",neg
"So parted they, as either's way them led.",neg
"But th' ape and fox ere long so well them sped,",neg
"Through the priest's wholesome counsel lately taught,",neg
"And through their own fair handling wisely wrought,",neg
That they a benefice 'twixt them obtained;,neg
"And crafty Reynold was a priest ordained,",neg
And th' ape his parish clerk procur'd to be.,neg
Then made they revel rout and goodly glee;,neg
"But, ere long time had passed, they so ill",neg
"Did order their affairs, that th' evil will",neg
Of all their parish'ners they had constrain'd;,neg
"Who to the Ordinary of them complain'd,",neg
"How foully they their offices abus'd,",neg
"And them of crimes and heresies accus'd,",neg
That pursuivants he often for them sent;,neg
But they neglected his commandement.,neg
"So long persisted obstinate and bold,",neg
Till at the length he published to hold,neg
"A visitation, and them cited thether:",neg
Then was high time their wits about to geather.,neg
"What did they then, but made a composition",neg
"With their next neighbour priest, for light condition,",neg
To whom their living they resigned quite,neg
"For a few pence, and ran away by night.",neg
"CALM was the day, and through the trembling air",neg
"Sweet breathing Zephyrus did softly play,",neg
"A gentle spirit, that lightly did delay",neg
"Hot Titan's beams, which then did glister fair;",neg
"When I whose sullen care,",neg
Through discontent of my long fruitless stay,neg
"In prince's court, and expectation vain",neg
"Of idle hopes, which still do fly away",neg
"Like empty shadows, did afflict my brain,",neg
Walked forth to ease my pain,neg
"Along the shore of silver streaming Thames,",neg
"Whose rutty bank, the which his river hems,",neg
"Was painted all with variable flowers,",neg
"And all the meads adorned with dainty gems,",neg
"Fit to deck maidens' bowers,",neg
"And crown their paramours,",neg
"Against the bridal day, which is not long:",neg
"      Sweet Thames, run softly, till I end my song.",neg
"There, in a meadow, by the river's side,",neg
"A flock of nymphs I chanced to espy,",neg
"All lovely daughters of the flood thereby,",neg
"With goodly greenish locks, all loose untied,",neg
As each had been a bride;,neg
"And each one had a little wicker basket,",neg
"Made of fine twigs, entrailed curiously,",neg
"In which they gathered flowers to fill their flasket,",neg
And with fine fingers cropt full featously,neg
The tender stalks on high.,neg
"Of every sort, which in that meadow grew,",neg
"They gathered some; the violet pallid blue,",neg
"The little daisy, that at evening closes,",neg
"The virgin lily, and the primrose true,",neg
"With store of vermeil roses,",neg
To deck their bridegrooms' posies,neg
"Against the bridal day, which was not long:",neg
"      Sweet Thames, run softly, till I end my song.",neg
"With that, I saw two swans of goodly hue",neg
Come softly swimming down along the Lee;,neg
Two fairer birds I yet did never see.,neg
"The snow which doth the top of Pindus strew,",neg
"Did never whiter shew,",neg
"Nor Jove himself, when he a swan would be",neg
"For love of Leda, whiter did appear:",neg
"Yet Leda was they say as white as he,",neg
"Yet not so white as these, nor nothing near.",neg
"So purely white they were,",neg
"That even the gentle stream, the which them bare,",neg
"Seemed foul to them, and bade his billows spare",neg
"To wet their silken feathers, lest they might",neg
"Soil their fair plumes with water not so fair,",neg
"And mar their beauties bright,",neg
"That shone as heaven's light,",neg
"Against their bridal day, which was not long:",neg
"      Sweet Thames, run softly, till I end my song.",neg
"Eftsoons the nymphs, which now had flowers their fill,",neg
"Ran all in haste, to see that silver brood,",neg
As they came floating on the crystal flood.,neg
"Whom when they saw, they stood amazed still,",neg
Their wondering eyes to fill.,neg
"Them seemed they never saw a sight so fair,",neg
"Of fowls so lovely, that they sure did deem",neg
"Them heavenly born, or to be that same pair",neg
Which through the sky draw Venus' silver team;,neg
For sure they did not seem,neg
"To be begot of any earthly seed,",neg
"But rather angels, or of angels' breed:",neg
"Yet were they bred of Somers-heat they say,",neg
"In sweetest season, when each flower and weed",neg
"The earth did fresh array,",neg
"So fresh they seemed as day,",neg
"Even as their bridal day, which was not long:",neg
"      Sweet Thames, run softly, till I end my song.",neg
Then forth they all out of their baskets drew,neg
"Great store of flowers, the honour of the field,",neg
"That to the sense did fragrant odours yield,",neg
"All which upon those goodly birds they threw,",neg
"And all the waves did strew,",neg
"That like old Peneus' waters they did seem,",neg
"When down along by pleasant Tempe's shore,",neg
"Scattered with flowers, through Thessaly they stream,",neg
"That they appear through lilies' plenteous store,",neg
Like a bride's chamber floor.,neg
"Two of those nymphs meanwhile, two garlands bound,",neg
"Of freshest flowers which in that mead they found,",neg
"The which presenting all in trim array,",neg
"Their snowy foreheads therewithal they crowned,",neg
"Whilst one did sing this lay,",neg
"Prepared against that day,",neg
"Against their bridal day, which was not long:",neg
"      Sweet Thames, run softly, till I end my song.",neg
"'Ye gentle birds, the world's fair ornament,",neg
"And heaven's glory, whom this happy hour",neg
"Doth lead unto your lovers' blissful bower,",neg
Joy may you have and gentle heart's content,neg
Of your love's complement:,neg
"And let fair Venus, that is queen of love,",neg
"With her heart-quelling son upon you smile,",neg
"Whose smile, they say, hath virtue to remove",neg
"All love's dislike, and friendship's faulty guile",neg
For ever to assoil.,neg
"Let endless peace your steadfast hearts accord,",neg
"And blessed plenty wait upon your board,",neg
"And let your bed with pleasures chaste abound,",neg
"That fruitful issue may to you afford,",neg
"Which may your foes confound,",neg
And make your joys redound,neg
"Upon your bridal day, which is not long:",neg
"      Sweet Thames, run softly, till I end my song.'",neg
So ended she; and all the rest around,neg
"To her redoubled that her undersong,",neg
Which said their bridal day should not be long.,neg
And gentle echo from the neighbour ground,neg
Their accents did resound.,neg
"So forth those joyous birds did pass along,",neg
"Adown the Lee, that to them murmured low,",neg
"As he would speak, but that he lacked a tongue,",neg
"Yet did by signs his glad affection show,",neg
Making his stream run slow.,neg
And all the fowl which in his flood did dwell,neg
"Gan flock about these twain, that did excel",neg
The rest so far as Cynthia doth shend,neg
"The lesser stars. So they, enranged well,",neg
"Did on those two attend,",neg
"And their best service lend,",neg
"Against their wedding day, which was not long:",neg
"      Sweet Thames, run softly, till I end my song.",neg
"At length they all to merry London came,",neg
"To merry London, my most kindly nurse,",neg
That to me gave this life's first native source;,neg
"Though from another place I take my name,",neg
An house of ancient fame.,neg
"There when they came, whereas those bricky towers,",neg
"The which on Thames' broad aged back do ride,",neg
Where now the studious lawyers have their bowers,neg
"There whilom wont the Templar Knights to bide,",neg
Till they decayed through pride:,neg
"Next whereunto there stands a stately place,",neg
Where oft I gained gifts and goodly grace,neg
"Of that great lord, which therein wont to dwell,",neg
Whose want too well now feels my friendless case.,neg
"But ah, here fits not well",neg
Old woes but joys to tell,neg
"Against the bridal day, which is not long:",neg
"      Sweet Thames, run softly, till I end my song.",neg
"Yet therein now doth lodge a noble peer,",neg
"Great England's glory, and the world's wide wonder,",neg
"Whose dreadful name late through all Spain did thunder,",neg
And Hercules' two pillars standing near,neg
Did make to quake and fear:,neg
"Fair branch of honour, flower of chivalry,",neg
"That fillest England with thy triumph's fame,",neg
"Joy have thou of thy noble victory,",neg
And endless happiness of thine own name,neg
That promiseth the same:,neg
"That through thy prowess and victorious arms,",neg
Thy country may be freed from foreign harms;,neg
And great Elisa's glorious name may ring,neg
"Through all the world, filled with thy wide alarms,",neg
Which some brave Muse may sing,neg
"To ages following,",neg
"Upon the bridal day, which is not long:",neg
"      Sweet Thames, run softly, till I end my song.",neg
"From those high towers this noble lord issuing,",neg
Like radiant Hesper when his golden hair,neg
"In th'Ocean billows he hath bathed fair,",neg
"Descended to the river's open viewing,",neg
With a great train ensuing.,neg
Above the rest were goodly to be seen,neg
Two gentle knights of lovely face and feature,neg
"Beseeming well the bower of any queen,",neg
"With gifts of wit and ornaments of nature,",neg
Fit for so goodly stature;,neg
"That like the twins of Jove they seemed in sight,",neg
Which deck the baldric of the heavens bright.,neg
"They two forth pacing to the river's side,",neg
"Received those two fair birds, their love's delight;",neg
"Which, at th' appointed tide,",neg
Each one did make his bride,neg
"Against their bridal day, which is not long:",neg
"      Sweet Thames, run softly, till I end my song.",neg
"Tell me good Hobbinoll, what garres thee greete?",neg
What? hath some Wolfe thy tender Lambes ytorne?,neg
"Or is thy Bagpype broke, that soundes so sweete?",neg
Or art thou of thy loved lasse forlorne?,neg
"Or bene thine eyes attempred to the yeare,",neg
Quenching the gasping furrowes thirst with rayne?,neg
"Like April shoure, so stremes the trickling teares",neg
"Adowne thy cheeke, to quenche thy thristye payne.",neg
"Nor thys, nor that, so muche doeth make me mourne,",neg
"But for the ladde, whome long I lovd so deare,",neg
"Nowe loves a lasse, that all his love doth scorne:",neg
"He plongd in payne, his tressed locks dooth teare.",neg
"Shepheards delights he dooth them all forsweare,",neg
"Hys pleasaunt Pipe, whych made us meriment,",neg
"He wylfully hath broke, and doth forbeare",neg
"His wonted songs, wherein he all outwent.",neg
"What is he for a Ladde, you so lament?",neg
"Ys love such pinching payne to them, that prove?",neg
"And hath he skill to make so excellent,",neg
Yet hath so little skill to brydle love?,neg
"Colin thou kenst, the Southerne shepheardes boye:",neg
Him Love hath wounded with a deadly darte.,neg
"Whilome on him was all my care and joye,",neg
Forcing with gyfts to winne his wanton heart.,neg
"But now from me hys madding mynd is starte,",neg
And woes the Widdowes daughter of the glenne:,neg
"So nowe fayre Rosalind hath bredde hys smart,",neg
So now his frend is chaunged for a frenne.,neg

For which she laboured hard both day and night,neg
In harvest time whilst she might go and glean;,neg

Through discontent of my long fruitless stay,neg
"In prince's court, and expectation vain",neg
"Of idle hopes, which still do fly away",neg
"Like empty shadows, did afflict my brain,",neg
Walked forth to ease my pain,neg
"Along the shore of silver streaming Thames,",neg

"Was painted all with variable flowers,",neg
"And all the meads adorned with dainty gems,",neg
"Fit to deck maidens' bowers,",neg
"And crown their paramours,",neg
"Against the bridal day, which is not long:",neg
"      Sweet Thames, run softly, till I end my song.",neg
"There, in a meadow, by the river's side,",neg
"A flock of nymphs I chanced to espy,",neg
"All lovely daughters of the flood thereby,",neg
"With goodly greenish locks, all loose untied,",neg
As each had been a bride;,neg
"And each one had a little wicker basket,",neg
"Made of fine twigs, entrailed curiously,",neg
"In which they gathered flowers to fill their flasket,",neg
And with fine fingers cropt full featously,neg
The tender stalks on high.,neg
"Of every sort, which in that meadow grew,",neg
"They gathered some; the violet pallid blue,",neg
"The little daisy, that at evening closes,",neg
"The virgin lily, and the primrose true,",neg
"With store of vermeil roses,",neg
To deck their bridegrooms' posies,neg
"Against the bridal day, which was not long:",neg
"      Sweet Thames, run softly, till I end my song.",neg
"With that, I saw two swans of goodly hue",neg
Come softly swimming down along the Lee;,neg
Two fairer birds I yet did never see.,neg
"The snow which doth the top of Pindus strew,",neg
"Did never whiter shew,",neg
"Nor Jove himself, when he a swan would be",neg
"For love of Leda, whiter did appear:",neg
"Yet Leda was they say as white as he,",neg
"Yet not so white as these, nor nothing near.",neg
"So purely white they were,",neg
"That even the gentle stream, the which them bare,",neg
"Seemed foul to them, and bade his billows spare",neg
"To wet their silken feathers, lest they might",neg
"Soil their fair plumes with water not so fair,",neg
"And mar their beauties bright,",neg
"That shone as heaven's light,",neg
"Against their bridal day, which was not long:",neg
"      Sweet Thames, run softly, till I end my song.",neg
"Eftsoons the nymphs, which now had flowers their fill,",neg
"Ran all in haste, to see that silver brood,",neg
As they came floating on the crystal flood.,neg
"Whom when they saw, they stood amazed still,",neg
Their wondering eyes to fill.,neg
"Them seemed they never saw a sight so fair,",neg
"Of fowls so lovely, that they sure did deem",neg
"Them heavenly born, or to be that same pair",neg
Which through the sky draw Venus' silver team;,neg
For sure they did not seem,neg
"To be begot of any earthly seed,",neg
"But rather angels, or of angels' breed:",neg
"Yet were they bred of Somers-heat they say,",neg
"In sweetest season, when each flower and weed",neg
"The earth did fresh array,",neg
"So fresh they seemed as day,",neg
"Even as their bridal day, which was not long:",neg
"      Sweet Thames, run softly, till I end my song.",neg
Then forth they all out of their baskets drew,neg
"Great store of flowers, the honour of the field,",neg
"That to the sense did fragrant odours yield,",neg
"All which upon those goodly birds they threw,",neg
"And all the waves did strew,",neg
"That like old Peneus' waters they did seem,",neg
"When down along by pleasant Tempe's shore,",neg
"Scattered with flowers, through Thessaly they stream,",neg
"That they appear through lilies' plenteous store,",neg
Like a bride's chamber floor.,neg
"Two of those nymphs meanwhile, two garlands bound,",neg
"Of freshest flowers which in that mead they found,",neg
"The which presenting all in trim array,",neg
"Their snowy foreheads therewithal they crowned,",neg

"All love's dislike, and friendship's faulty guile",neg
For ever to assoil.,neg

So ended she; and all the rest around,neg
"To her redoubled that her undersong,",neg
Which said their bridal day should not be long.,neg
And gentle echo from the neighbour ground,neg
Their accents did resound.,neg
"So forth those joyous birds did pass along,",neg
"Adown the Lee, that to them murmured low,",neg
"As he would speak, but that he lacked a tongue,",neg
"Yet did by signs his glad affection show,",neg
Making his stream run slow.,neg
And all the fowl which in his flood did dwell,neg
"Gan flock about these twain, that did excel",neg
The rest so far as Cynthia doth shend,neg
"The lesser stars. So they, enranged well,",neg
"Did on those two attend,",neg

"At length they all to merry London came,",neg
"To merry London, my most kindly nurse,",neg
That to me gave this life's first native source;,neg

An house of ancient fame.,neg

"The which on Thames' broad aged back do ride,",neg
Where now the studious lawyers have their bowers,neg
"There whilom wont the Templar Knights to bide,",neg
Till they decayed through pride:,neg
"Next whereunto there stands a stately place,",neg
Where oft I gained gifts and goodly grace,neg
"Of that great lord, which therein wont to dwell,",neg
Whose want too well now feels my friendless case.,neg
"But ah, here fits not well",neg
Old woes but joys to tell,neg

"Yet therein now doth lodge a noble peer,",neg
"Great England's glory, and the world's wide wonder,",neg

"Joy have thou of thy noble victory,",neg
And endless happiness of thine own name,neg
That promiseth the same:,neg
"That through thy prowess and victorious arms,",neg
Thy country may be freed from foreign harms;,neg
And great Elisa's glorious name may ring,neg
"Through all the world, filled with thy wide alarms,",neg
Which some brave Muse may sing,neg
"To ages following,",neg
"Upon the bridal day, which is not long:",neg
"      Sweet Thames, run softly, till I end my song.",neg
"From those high towers this noble lord issuing,",neg
Like radiant Hesper when his golden hair,neg

With a great train ensuing.,neg
Above the rest were goodly to be seen,neg
Two gentle knights of lovely face and feature,neg
"Beseeming well the bower of any queen,",neg

Fit for so goodly stature;,neg

Which deck the baldric of the heavens bright.,neg
"They two forth pacing to the river's side,",neg
"Received those two fair birds, their love's delight;",neg
"Which, at th' appointed tide,",neg
Each one did make his bride,neg
