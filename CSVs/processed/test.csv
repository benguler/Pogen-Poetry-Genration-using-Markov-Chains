The day before Curl Trenary,modern_love
Swore out a warrant through Justice Arnett,modern_love
For stealing hogs.,modern_love
But that's not the reason he turned a soldier.,modern_love
He caught me running with Lucius Atherton.,modern_love
We quarreled and I told him never again,modern_love
To cross my path.,modern_love
Then he stole the hogs and went to the war,modern_love
Back of every soldier is a woman.He protested all his life long,modern_love
The newspapers lied about him villainously;,modern_love
"That he was not at fault for Minerva's fall,",modern_love
But only tried to help her.,modern_love
Poor soul so sunk in sin he could not see,modern_love
"That even trying to help her, as he called it,",modern_love
He had broken the law human and divine.,modern_love
"Passers by, an ancient admonition to you:",modern_love
"If your ways would be ways of pleasantness,",modern_love
"And all your pathways peace,",modern_love
Love God and keep his commandments.,modern_love
"And lights were paling out of the West,",modern_love
"You would come hither, and bend your head,",modern_love
And I would lay my head on your breast;,modern_love
"And you would murmur tender words,",modern_love
"Forgiving me, because you were dead:",modern_love
"Nor would you rise and hasten away,",modern_love
"Though you have the will of wild birds,",modern_love
But know your hair was bound and wound,modern_love
About the stars and moon and sun:,modern_love
"O would, beloved, that you lay",modern_love
"Under the dock-leaves in the ground,",modern_love
"While lights were paling one by one.Never give all the heart, for love",modern_love
Will hardly seem worth thinking of,modern_love
To passionate women if it seem,modern_love
"Certain, and they never dream",modern_love
That it fades out from kiss to kiss;,modern_love
For everything thats lovely is,modern_love
"But a brief, dreamy, kind delight.",modern_love
"O never give the heart outright,",modern_love
"For they, for all smooth lips can say,",modern_love
Have given their hearts up to the play.,modern_love
And who could play it well enough,modern_love
If deaf and dumb and blind with love?,modern_love
"He that made this knows all the cost,",modern_love
For he gave all his heart and lost.Why should I blame her that she filled my days,modern_love
"With misery, or that she would of late",modern_love
"Have taught to ignorant men most violent ways,",modern_love
"Or hurled the little streets upon the great,",modern_love
Had they but courage equal to desire?,modern_love
What could have made her peaceful with a mind,modern_love
"That nobleness made simple as a fire,",modern_love
"With beauty like a tightened bow, a kind",modern_love
"That is not natural in an age like this,",modern_love
Being high and solitary and most stern?,modern_love
"Why, what could she have done, being what she is?",modern_love
Was there another Troy for her to burn?Some may have blamed you that you took away,modern_love
The verses that could move them on the day,modern_love
"When, the ears being deafened, the sight of the eyes blind",modern_love
"With lightning, you went from me, and I could find",modern_love
"Nothing to make a song about but kings,",modern_love
"Helmets, and swords, and half-forgotten things",modern_love
That were like memories of youbut now,modern_love
"We'll out, for the world lives as long ago;",modern_love
"And while we're in our laughing, weeping fit,",modern_love
"Hurl helmets, crowns, and swords into the pit.",modern_love
"But, dear, cling close to me; since you were gone,",modern_love
"My barren thoughts have chilled me to the bone.Shy one, shy one,",modern_love
"Shy one of my heart,",modern_love
She moves in the firelight,modern_love
Pensively apart.,modern_love
"She carries in the dishes,",modern_love
And lays them in a row.,modern_love
To an isle in the water,modern_love
With her would I go.,modern_love
"She carries in the candles,",modern_love
"And lights the curtained room,",modern_love
Shy in the doorway,modern_love
And shy in the gloom;,modern_love
"And shy as a rabbit,",modern_love
Helpful and shy.,modern_love
To an isle in the water,modern_love
"With her would I fly.I feel the spring far off, far off,",modern_love
"    The faint, far scent of bud and leaf",modern_love
"Oh, how can spring take heart to come",modern_love
"    To a world in grief,",modern_love
    Deep grief?,modern_love
 ,modern_love
"The sun turns north, the days grow long,",modern_love
    Later the evening star grows bright,modern_love
How can the daylight linger on,modern_love
"    For men to fight,",modern_love
    Still fight?,modern_love
 ,modern_love
"The grass is waking in the ground,",modern_love
    Soon it will rise and blow in waves,modern_love
How can it have the heart to sway,modern_love
"    Over the graves,",modern_love
    New graves?,modern_love
 ,modern_love
Under the boughs where lovers walked,modern_love
How could they do it? ,modern_mythology_folklore
Those souls that usually dived ,modern_mythology_folklore
Into the dirty caverns of mines; ,modern_mythology_folklore
Who usually hived ,modern_mythology_folklore
In whitened hovels; under ragged poplars; ,modern_mythology_folklore
"Who dragged muddy shovels, over the grassy mud, ",modern_mythology_folklore
Lumbering to work over the greasy sods. . . ,modern_mythology_folklore
"Those men there, with the appearance of clods ",modern_mythology_folklore
Were the bravest men that a usually listless priest of God ,modern_mythology_folklore
Ever shrived. . . ,modern_mythology_folklore
And it is not for us to make them an anthem. ,modern_mythology_folklore
If we found words there would come no wind that would fan them ,modern_mythology_folklore
"To a tune that the trumpets might blow it, ",modern_mythology_folklore
"Shrill through the heaven that's ours or yet Allah's, ",modern_mythology_folklore
Or the wide halls of any Valhallas. ,modern_mythology_folklore
We can make no such anthem. So that all that is ours ,modern_mythology_folklore
"For inditing in sonnets, pantoums, elegiacs, or lays ",modern_mythology_folklore
Is this: ,modern_mythology_folklore
"In the name of God, how could they do it? ",modern_mythology_folklore
II ,modern_mythology_folklore
"For there is no new thing under the sun, ",modern_mythology_folklore
Only this uncomely man with a smoking gun ,modern_mythology_folklore
In the gloom. . . ,modern_mythology_folklore
What the devil will he gain by it? ,modern_mythology_folklore
Digging a hole in the mud and standing all day in the rain by it ,modern_mythology_folklore
Waiting his doom; ,modern_mythology_folklore
"The sharp blow, the swift outpouring of the blood, ",modern_mythology_folklore
Till the trench of gray mud ,modern_mythology_folklore
Is turned to a brown purple drain by it. ,modern_mythology_folklore
"Well, there have been scars ",modern_mythology_folklore
Won in many wars . . .,modern_mythology_folklore
"Punic, ",modern_mythology_folklore
"Lacedmonian, wars of Napoleon, wars for faith, wars for honour, for love, for possession, ",modern_mythology_folklore
"But this Belgian man in his ugly tunic, ",modern_mythology_folklore
"His ugly round cap, shooting on, in a sort of obsession, ",modern_mythology_folklore
"Overspreading his miserable land, ",modern_mythology_folklore
Standing with his wet gun in his hand . . . ,modern_mythology_folklore
Doom! ,modern_mythology_folklore
"He finds that in a sudden scrimmage, ",modern_mythology_folklore
"And lies, an unsightly lump on the sodden grass . . . ",modern_mythology_folklore
An image that shall take long to pass! ,modern_mythology_folklore
III ,modern_mythology_folklore
For the white-limbed heroes of Hellas ride by upon their horses ,modern_mythology_folklore
Forever through our brains. ,modern_mythology_folklore
The heroes of Cressy ride by upon their stallions; ,modern_mythology_folklore
And battalions and battalions and battalions ,modern_mythology_folklore
"The Old Guard, the Young Guard, the men of Minden and of Waterloo, ",modern_mythology_folklore
"Pass, for ever staunch, ",modern_mythology_folklore
"Stand, for ever true; ",modern_mythology_folklore
"And the small man with the large paunch, ",modern_mythology_folklore
"And the gray coat, and the large hat, and the hands behind the back, ",modern_mythology_folklore
Watches them pass ,modern_mythology_folklore
In our minds for ever . . . ,modern_mythology_folklore
But that clutter of sodden corses ,modern_mythology_folklore
On the sodden Belgian grass ,modern_mythology_folklore
That is a strange new beauty. ,modern_mythology_folklore
IV ,modern_mythology_folklore
"With no especial legends of marchings or triumphs or duty, ",modern_mythology_folklore
"Assuredly that is the way of it, ",modern_mythology_folklore
The way of beauty . . . ,modern_mythology_folklore
And that is the highest word you can find to say of it. ,modern_mythology_folklore
For you cannot praise it with words ,modern_mythology_folklore
"Compounded of lyres and swords, ",modern_mythology_folklore
But the thought of the gloom and the rain ,modern_mythology_folklore
"And the ugly coated figure, standing beside a drain, ",modern_mythology_folklore
Shall eat itself into your brain: ,modern_mythology_folklore
"And you will say of all heroes, They fought like the Belgians! ",modern_mythology_folklore
And you will say: He wrought like a Belgian his fate out of gloom. ,modern_mythology_folklore
And you will say: He bought like a Belgian his doom. ,modern_mythology_folklore
And that shall be an honourable name; ,modern_mythology_folklore
Belgian shall be an honourable word; ,modern_mythology_folklore
"As honourable as the fame of the sword, ",modern_mythology_folklore
"As honourable as the mention of the many-chorded lyre, ",modern_mythology_folklore
And his old coat shall seem as beautiful as the fabrics woven in Tyre. ,modern_mythology_folklore
V ,modern_mythology_folklore
And what in the world did they bear it for? ,modern_mythology_folklore
I don't know. ,modern_mythology_folklore
And what in the world did they dare it for? ,modern_mythology_folklore
Perhaps that is not for the likes of me to understand. ,modern_mythology_folklore
They could very well have watched a hundred legions go ,modern_mythology_folklore
Over their fields and between their cities ,modern_mythology_folklore
Down into more southerly regions. ,modern_mythology_folklore
"They could very well have let the legions pass through their woods, ",modern_mythology_folklore
And have kept their lives and their wives and their children and cattle and goods. ,modern_mythology_folklore
I don't understand. ,modern_mythology_folklore
Was it just love of their land? ,modern_mythology_folklore
"Oh, poor dears! ",modern_mythology_folklore
Can any man so love his land? ,modern_mythology_folklore
Give them a thousand thousand pities ,modern_mythology_folklore
And rivers and rivers of tears ,modern_mythology_folklore
To wash off the blood from the cities of Flanders. ,modern_mythology_folklore
VI ,modern_mythology_folklore
This is Charing Cross; ,modern_mythology_folklore
It is midnight; ,modern_mythology_folklore
There is a great crowd ,modern_mythology_folklore
And no light. ,modern_mythology_folklore
"A great crowd, all black that hardly whispers aloud. ",modern_mythology_folklore
"Surely, that is a dead womana dead mother! ",modern_mythology_folklore
She has a dead face; ,modern_mythology_folklore
She is dressed all in black; ,modern_mythology_folklore
"She wanders to the bookstall and back, ",modern_mythology_folklore
Recall the years before her mind,modern_nature
"Became a bitter, an abstract thing,",modern_nature
Her thought some popular enmity:,modern_nature
Blind and leader of the blind,modern_nature
Drinking the foul ditch where they lie?,modern_nature
When long ago I saw her ride,modern_nature
"Under Ben Bulben to the meet,",modern_nature
The beauty of her country-side,modern_nature
"With all youth's lonely wildness stirred,",modern_nature
She seemed to have grown clean and sweet,modern_nature
"Like any rock-bred, sea-borne bird:",modern_nature
"Sea-borne, or balanced in the air",modern_nature
When first it sprang out of the nest,modern_nature
Upon some lofty rock to stare,modern_nature
"Upon the cloudy canopy,",modern_nature
While under its storm-beaten breast,modern_nature
"Cried out the hollows of the sea.There was a man whom Sorrow named his friend,",modern_nature
"And he, of his high comrade Sorrow dreaming,",modern_nature
Went walking with slow steps along the gleaming,modern_nature
"And humming sands, where windy surges wend:",modern_nature
And he called loudly to the stars to bend,modern_nature
"From their pale thrones and comfort him, but they",modern_nature
Among themselves laugh on and sing alway:,modern_nature
And then the man whom Sorrow named his friend,modern_nature
"Cried out, Dim sea, hear my most piteous story!",modern_nature
"The sea swept on and cried her old cry still,",modern_nature
Rolling along in dreams from hill to hill.,modern_nature
He fled the persecution of her glory,modern_nature
"And, in a far-off, gentle valley stopping,",modern_nature
Cried all his story to the dewdrops glistening.,modern_nature
"But naught they heard, for they are always listening,",modern_nature
"The dewdrops, for the sound of their own dropping.",modern_nature
And then the man whom Sorrow named his friend,modern_nature
"Sought once again the shore, and found a shell,",modern_nature
"And thought, I will my heavy story tell",modern_nature
"Till my own words, re-echoing, shall send",modern_nature
"Their sadness through a hollow, pearly heart;",modern_nature
"And my own tale again for me shall sing,",modern_nature
"And my own whispering words be comforting,",modern_nature
And lo! my ancient burden may depart.,modern_nature
Then he sang softly nigh the pearly rim;,modern_nature
But the sad dweller by the sea-ways lone,modern_nature
Changed all he sang to inarticulate moan,modern_nature
"Among her wildering whirls, forgetting him.The woods of Arcady are dead,",modern_nature
And over is their antique joy;,modern_nature
Of old the world on dreaming fed;,modern_nature
Grey Truth is now her painted toy;,modern_nature
Yet still she turns her restless head:,modern_nature
"But O, sick children of the world,",modern_nature
Of all the many changing things,modern_nature
"In dreary dancing past us whirled,",modern_nature
"To the cracked tune that Chronos sings,",modern_nature
Words alone are certain good.,modern_nature
"Where are now the warring kings,",modern_nature
Word be-mockers?  By the Rood,modern_nature
Where are now the warring kings?,modern_nature
"An idle word is now their glory,",modern_nature
"By the stammering schoolboy said,",modern_nature
Reading some entangled story:,modern_nature
The kings of the old time are dead;,modern_nature
The wandering earth herself may be,modern_nature
"Only a sudden flaming word,",modern_nature
"In clanging space a moment heard,",modern_nature
Troubling the endless reverie.,modern_nature
"Then nowise worship dusty deeds,",modern_nature
"Nor seek, for this is also sooth,",modern_nature
"To hunger fiercely after truth,",modern_nature
Lest all thy toiling only breeds,modern_nature
"New dreams, new dreams; there is no truth",modern_nature
"Saving in thine own heart. Seek, then,",modern_nature
"No learning from the starry men,",modern_nature
Who follow with the optic glass,modern_nature
The whirling ways of stars that pass  ,modern_nature
"Seek, then, for this is also sooth,",modern_nature
No word of theirs  the cold star-bane,modern_nature
"Has cloven and rent their hearts in twain,",modern_nature
And dead is all their human truth.,modern_nature
Go gather by the humming sea,modern_nature
"Some twisted, echo-harbouring shell,",modern_nature
"And to its lips thy story tell,",modern_nature
"And they thy comforters will be,",modern_nature
Rewarding in melodious guile,modern_nature
"Thy fretful words a little while,",modern_nature
Till they shall singing fade in ruth,modern_nature
And die a pearly brotherhood;,modern_nature
For words alone are certain good:,modern_nature
"Sing, then, for this is also sooth.",modern_nature
I must be gone: there is a grave,modern_nature
"Where daffodil and lily wave,",modern_nature
"And I would please the hapless faun,",modern_nature
"Buried under the sleepy ground,",modern_nature
With mirthful songs before the dawn.,modern_nature
His shouting days with mirth were crowned;,modern_nature
"And still I dream he treads the lawn,",modern_nature
"Walking ghostly in the dew,",modern_nature
"Pierced by my glad singing through,",modern_nature
My songs of old earth's dreamy youth:,modern_nature
But ah! she dreams not now; dream thou!,modern_nature
For fair are poppies on the brow:,modern_nature
"Dream, dream, for this is also sooth.",modern_nature
Only the wanderer,modern_nature
On the sole Arabian tree,renaissance_love
"Herald sad and trumpet be,",renaissance_love
To whose sound chaste wings obey.,renaissance_love
"But thou shrieking harbinger,",renaissance_love
"Foul precurrer of the fiend,",renaissance_love
"Augur of the fever's end,",renaissance_love
To this troop come thou not near.,renaissance_love
From this session interdict,renaissance_love
"Every fowl of tyrant wing,",renaissance_love
"Save the eagle, feather'd king;",renaissance_love
Keep the obsequy so strict.,renaissance_love
"Let the priest in surplice white,",renaissance_love
"That defunctive music can,",renaissance_love
"Be the death-divining swan,",renaissance_love
Lest the requiem lack his right.,renaissance_love
"And thou treble-dated crow,",renaissance_love
That thy sable gender mak'st,renaissance_love
"With the breath thou giv'st and tak'st,",renaissance_love
'Mongst our mourners shalt thou go.,renaissance_love
Here the anthem doth commence:,renaissance_love
Love and constancy is dead;,renaissance_love
Phoenix and the Turtle fled,renaissance_love
In a mutual flame from hence.,renaissance_love
"So they lov'd, as love in twain",renaissance_love
Had the essence but in one;,renaissance_love
"Two distincts, division none:",renaissance_love
Number there in love was slain.,renaissance_love
"Hearts remote, yet not asunder;",renaissance_love
Distance and no space was seen,renaissance_love
'Twixt this Turtle and his queen:,renaissance_love
But in them it were a wonder.,renaissance_love
So between them love did shine,renaissance_love
That the Turtle saw his right,renaissance_love
Flaming in the Phoenix' sight:,renaissance_love
Either was the other's mine.,renaissance_love
Property was thus appalled,renaissance_love
That the self was not the same;,renaissance_love
Single nature's double name,renaissance_love
Neither two nor one was called.,renaissance_love
"Reason, in itself confounded,",renaissance_love
"Saw division grow together,",renaissance_love
"To themselves yet either neither,",renaissance_love
Simple were so well compounded;,renaissance_love
"That it cried, How true a twain",renaissance_love
Seemeth this concordant one!,renaissance_love
"Love has reason, reason none,",renaissance_love
If what parts can so remain.,renaissance_love
Whereupon it made this threne,renaissance_love
"To the Phoenix and the Dove,",renaissance_love
"Co-supremes and stars of love,",renaissance_love
As chorus to their tragic scene:,renaissance_love
                 threnos,renaissance_love
"Beauty, truth, and rarity,",renaissance_love
"Grace in all simplicity,",renaissance_love
"Here enclos'd, in cinders lie.",renaissance_love
"Death is now the Phoenix' nest,",renaissance_love
And the Turtle's loyal breast,renaissance_love
"To eternity doth rest,",renaissance_love
Leaving no posterity:,renaissance_love
"'Twas not their infirmity,",renaissance_love
It was married chastity.,renaissance_love
Truth may seem but cannot be;,renaissance_love
Beauty brag but 'tis not she;,renaissance_love
Truth and beauty buried be.,renaissance_love
To this urn let those repair,renaissance_love
That are either true or fair;,renaissance_love
For these dead birds sigh a prayer.,renaissance_love
"Sing lullaby, as women do,",renaissance_love
"Wherewith they bring their babes to rest,",renaissance_love
And lullaby can I sing too,renaissance_love
As womanly as can the best.,renaissance_love
"With lullaby they still the child,",renaissance_love
"And if I be not much beguiled,",renaissance_love
Full many wanton babes have I,renaissance_love
Which must be stilled with lullaby.,renaissance_love
     First lullaby my youthful years;,renaissance_love
"It is now time to go to bed,",renaissance_love
For crooked age and hoary hairs,renaissance_love
Have won the haven within my head.,renaissance_love
"With lullaby, then, youth be still;",renaissance_love
With lullaby content thy will;,renaissance_love
"Since courage quails and comes behind,",renaissance_love
"Go sleep, and so beguile thy mind.",renaissance_love
"     Next, lullaby my gazing eyes,",renaissance_love
Which wonted were to glance apace.,renaissance_love
For every glass may now suffice,renaissance_love
To show the furrows in my face;,renaissance_love
"With lullaby then wink awhile,",renaissance_love
With lullaby your looks beguile;,renaissance_love
Let no fair face nor beauty bright,renaissance_love
Entice you eft with vain delight.,renaissance_love
"     And lullaby, my wanton will;",renaissance_love
"Let reason's rule now reign thy thought,",renaissance_love
Since all too late I find by skill,renaissance_love
How dear I have thy fancies bought;,renaissance_love
"With lullaby now take thine ease,",renaissance_love
With lullaby thy doubts appease.,renaissance_love
"For trust to this: if thou be still,",renaissance_love
My body shall obey thy will.,renaissance_love
"     Eke lullaby, my loving boy,",renaissance_love
"My little Robin, take thy rest;",renaissance_love

"Sir Charles into my chamber coming in,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
When I was writing of my Fairy Queen;,renaissance_mythology_folklore
I praysaid hewhen Queen Mab you do see,renaissance_mythology_folklore
Present my service to her Majesty:,renaissance_mythology_folklore
And tell her I have heard Fame's loud report,renaissance_mythology_folklore
Both of her beauty and her stately court.,renaissance_mythology_folklore
"When I Queen Mab within my fancy viewed,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"My thoughts bowed low, fearing I should be rude;",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"Kissing her garment thin which fancy made,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"I knelt upon a thought, like one that prayed;",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"And then, in whispers soft, I did present",renaissance_mythology_folklore
His humble service which in mirth was sent;,renaissance_mythology_folklore
Thus by imagination I have been,renaissance_mythology_folklore
In Fairy court and seen the Fairy Queen.,renaissance_mythology_folklore
"Our vice runs beyond all that old men saw,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"And far authentically above our laws,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
