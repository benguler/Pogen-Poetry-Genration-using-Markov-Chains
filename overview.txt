MarkovAgent.py:
	Authored by Ben Guler
	Agent that uses markov probability matrix to generate words

Poem.py:
	Authored by Ben Guler
	Generates a poem with given restraints using a markov agent
	Pogen.py
	Authored by Alex Li
	Takes user input to get parameters to pass into a poem object and then displays a poem generated by the poem object to the command prompt

Csv-manipulation.ipynb:
	Authored by Alexandre Castro

	This file opens the main csv file (all.csv) and write to a new csv file according to the given fields

	filename - the name of the file

	AGE - Modern or Renaissance

	Type - Nature, Love, or Mythology & Folklore

	The code reads a poem by poem ('content') and writes to a new csv along with a TAG

	e.g. 
	This is a poem,
	Roses are red, violets are blue,
	programming in python all the way to the moon.,modern_love

Tokenization_of_poems.py
	Authored by Alexandre Castro
		
	This python script opens a csv file for reading and uses TextBlob to tokenize words into a set
	Moreover, the set is cast into a list for later usability
	By checkpoint 2 I will modify this file to tokenize each of the 6 csv files into 6 separate lists that will interact with the agent.

	Text_classification.ipynb
	Authored by Alexandre Castro
	This file is currently under construction
	This file will train the data sets with the Naive Bayes algorithm using TextBlob
